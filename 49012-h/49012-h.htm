<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The purpose of this essay is to trace the legislative and
judicial history of the grant to Congress of the power “to
establish postoffices and postroads,” and to discuss the constitutionality
of the proposals that, under this clause, federal
control may be extended to subjects over which Congress
has no direct authority. The essay is thus one in constitutional
expansion, and does not consider the history or efficiency
of the postoffice as an administrative arm of the
government. A treatment of this subject, which has as yet
received scant notice, I may some day attempt.</p>

<p>Portions of Chapters IV and VII have appeared as
articles on “Federal Interference with the Freedom of the
Press,” and “The Extension of Federal Control through
the Regulation of the Mails,” in the <i>Yale Law Journal</i>
(May, 1914) and the <i>Harvard Law Review</i> (November,
1913) respectively. They have been thoroughly revised for
publication in their present form. Chapter V appeared in
substantially the same form in the <i>Virginia Law Review</i>
(November, 1915).</p>

<p>I am under great obligations to Professor W.&nbsp;W. Willoughby,
not only for much direct assistance in the preparation
of this essay, but for the inspiration of his productive
scholarship.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, not insignificant that <i>The Federalist</i> contains
but a single reference to the power lodged in Congress
“to establish postoffices and postroads.” The writers of
that incomparable collection of political papers which discussed
in such exhaustive detail the disputed points of the
proposed governmental frame-work for the United States
of America, hardly needed to argue that the proposed delegation
could not be deemed dangerous and was admittedly
one of national concern. “The power of establishing postroads,”
said Madison, “must, in every view, be a harmless
power, and may, perhaps, by judicious management, become
productive of great public conveniency. Nothing which
tends to facilitate the intercourse between the states can be
deemed unworthy of the public care.”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>Half a century later, Story prefaced the discussion of this
power in his <i>Commentaries</i>, with the remark that, “One
cannot but feel, at the present time, an inclination to smile
at the guarded caution of these expressions, and the hesitating
avowal of the importance of the power. It affords,
perhaps, one of the most striking proofs, how much the
growth and prosperity of the country have outstripped
the most sanguine anticipations of our most enlightened
patriots.”<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>At the time Story wrote, the postal power had, of course,
already achieved a “commercial, political, intellectual and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
private” importance, “of incalculable value to the permanent
interests of the Union,” vital both to the government
and to individuals. But there was also the problem, lately
acute, as to whether Congress had simply the power “to
designate, or point out, what roads shall be mail roads, and
the right of passage or way along them when so designated,”
or the larger power “to construct any roads which Congress
may deem proper for the conveyance of the mail, and to
keep them in due repair for such purpose.”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> The remarkable
benefits already achieved and the disputed extensions
were the developments which excited Story’s surprise at the
unprophetic remark of <i>The Federalist</i>.</p>

<p>But for some time the postoffice has been a common
carrier and is now supplanting the express companies; it
exercises banking functions not only for facilitating exchange
but for savings deposits, and other collectivist activities
are most strongly urged. The Supreme Court of the
United States has upheld a broad power in Congress to
prevent and punish interference with the carriage of the
mails, and it is thus possible to make further extensions of
federal authority.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> The right to incorporate railways and
build postroads is firmly established, and assertions are made
that it is both competent and advisable for federal authority
to assume control of the telephone and telegraph systems
and perhaps the railways themselves. It is, finally, argued
that Congress may solve problems of purely local origin, and
of primary sectional concern, through the simple expedient
of denying the use of the mails unless certain regulative
conditions are complied with. Viewing these extensions as
either definitely upheld by the Supreme Court, or seriously
urged, one cannot now but smile at the “guarded caution”
of Story’s description and his “hesitating avowal” that
postroads might, with certain restrictions, be constructed
under federal auspices. The distinguished jurist, however,
wrote more prophetically than he knew, when he emphasized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
the importance of this power, “both theoretically and
practically.”</p>

<p>Yet it is not unnatural that at the time the Constitution
was framed, the importance of the postal power should have
been inadequately estimated, since, inherently, it must be
conditioned by the existing mechanical means of intercourse
and communication. It seemed that the nation would be
sufficiently fortunate were it to be born with promise of
maintaining existence, and it was neither possible nor advisable
to scrutinize its powers of which future necessity or
expediency might require an extension for the purposes of
the nation. And, moreover, the growth of postal facilities,
from their first manifestation up to the adoption of the Constitution
was not sufficiently pronounced to augur a great
deal for the future. Travel and intercourse were extremely
difficult; and the cognate questions were to come only with
the development of society.</p>

<p>The maintenance of postal facilities has always been a
recognized function of the state, and this was true even in
early Rome. In England, the sixteenth century saw the
first definite steps for the establishment of a service, but
even before this communications were carried by royal
messengers compensated by the Crown. Private posts
were, of course, used, but official letters on state matters
constituted so large a bulk of the correspondence and the
problem was one so fitted for solution by the state that it
was inevitable that the postal establishment should be conducted
under the auspices of, and supported directly by the
government.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>In the American colonies the first attempt to establish a
mail service was made in 1639 by the General Court of
Massachusetts. “For preventing the miscarriage of letters,
... It is ordered that notice bee given, that Richard Fairbanks,
his house in Boston, is the place appointed for all
letters, which are brought from beyond the seas, or are to
bee sent thither; ... are to bee brought to him and hee is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
take care, that they bee delivered or sent according to their
directions and hee is allowed for every such letter 1<i>d.</i> and
must answer for all miscarriages through his owne neglect
in this kind; provided no man shall bee compelled to bring
his letters thither except hee please.” So runs the entry in
the court records.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>This, however, applied only to foreign mail, and it was
not until December, 1672 that there was an effort to establish
a domestic post, Francis Lovelace, governor of New
York, taking the initiative, and his messenger going to Connecticut.
Soon afterwards the General Court of Massachusetts
appointed a postmaster and a proclamation was
issued by the home government calling for the establishment
of postoffices at convenient places on the American
continent.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>The office of postmaster general for America was created
in 1692, permission being granted Thomas Neale and his
executors by the Lords of Trade and Plantations to establish
“an office or offices for the receiving and dispatching
letters and pacquets, and to receive, send and deliver the
same under such rates and sums as the planters shall agree
to give.”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>The next forty years saw some extensions of postal facilities,
but the improvement was slight. In 1683 William
Penn established a postoffice in Pennsylvania, and in 1736
a weekly mail was begun between Boston and New York,
but intercolonial communication was very restricted, and it
was not until 1737, with the appointment of Benjamin
Franklin as postmaster general at Philadelphia and postmaster
general of the Colonies in 1753 that there were any
noticeable gains, or any signs of important developments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
for the state function of which he was placed in charge.
Franklin was active in establishing new posts as far as was
possible and began the practice of sending newspapers
through the mails free of charge. When he was turned out
of office in 1774, he wrote that “before I was displaced by a
freak of the ministers, we had brought it [the postoffice] to
yield three times as much clear revenue to the crown as the
postoffice in Ireland. Since that impudent transaction they
have received from it not one farthing.”<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>After Franklin’s dismissal the new postmaster at Philadelphia
raised the rates on newspapers to such proportions
that William Goddard, an editor of Baltimore and Philadelphia,
was forced to discontinue the publication of his
journal. In March, 1774 Goddard began a lengthy journey
through the New England States to gain support for the
“Constitutional American Post Office” which he hoped to
establish.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> A tentative line was inaugurated between
Baltimore and Philadelphia, but this was gradually extended
so as to provide tolerably adequate facilities for all of the
colonies, Goddard having secured the support of the assemblies
in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
New Jersey, and New York.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> He realized from the first
that the facilities he was seeking should be furnished under
the auspices of the Continental Congress, and when this
body acted on July 26, 1775 and agreed to the establishment
of a post, Goddard’s plans were accepted.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>The establishment of postal facilities was one of the very
first problems taken up by the Continental Congress when
it began to exercise sovereign powers which it did not
legally possess, but which of necessity it had to assume.
On May 29, 1775 the Congress resolved that, “As the
present critical situation of the colonies renders it highly
desirable that ways and means should be devised for the
speedy and secure conveyance of Intelligence from one end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
of the Continent to the other,” a committee be appointed to
consider the best means of establishing a post,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> and on July
26, 1775 the Congress took up the committee’s report, appointed
Benjamin Franklin postmaster general for the
United Colonies, established a line of communication from
Falmouth to Savannah and recommended the inauguration
of cross posts within the discretion of the postmaster general.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
Franking privileges were almost immediately established
for the members of Congress and for the army commanders,
and were later extended, with some limitations, to
private soldiers in the service.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>As yet the Congress had not aimed to make its postal
establishment a monopoly and so it was a question of war
policy rather than of the unrestricted exercise of a governmental
function which inspired the motion that the parliamentary
posts be stopped. Richard Henry Lee, for example,
argued that “the Ministry are mutilating our correspondence
in England, and our enemies here are corresponding
for our ruin;” but the better opinion prevailed
that the measure was an offensive one not proper at that
particular juncture. In fact the ministerial post had been
of service to the colonists in giving them information which
they could not otherwise have obtained, and so it was recommended
that the people use the constitutional establishment
as much as possible. Before the end of the year, as it
turned out, this problem was settled without the intervention
of Congress for the British postoffice stopped its service
in the colonies.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
During the war the adequacy of the postal facilities was
often before Congress. Committees were appointed to investigate
conditions; Congress by resolution appreciated the
fact that the “communication of intelligence with frequency
and despatch from one part to another of this extensive
continent, is essentially requisite to its safety.” The postmaster
general was therefore requested to exercise care in
the selection of riders and to discharge dilatory ones when
discovered. Deputy postmasters were excused “from those
public duties which may call them from attendance at their
offices;” admonitory resolutions directed ferry keepers to
expedite the passage of postriders, and a public monopoly
was aimed at through the indirect method of reducing the
wages of government messengers who carried private
packages.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>On November 7, 1776, Richard Bache was appointed postmaster
general vice Franklin who had gone on the mission
to France, and after this change the attempts of Congress
to improve the service seem to be more frequent.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> In
January of the next year, Bache was requested to furnish a
list of those in the service, it having been reported that
“persons disaffected to the American cause” had been employed
“with the most mischievous effects” and he was
further requested to “assign reasons why the late resolves
of Congress for regulating the postoffice are not carried into
execution.”<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> In February a committee was appointed to
revise the regulations; it recommended extensions and suggested
that all employees be required to take an “oath of
fidelity to the United States and also an oath of office,” and
urged that once in six months the postmaster general be
required to transmit to Congress a list of those in the
service.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> The legislatures of the states were asked to
exempt from all military duties “persons immediately concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
in conducting the business of the postoffice,” but still
the establishment did not work to the satisfaction of Congress,
and other committees were appointed to make recommendations
and the rates of postage were several times increased.
One new step was taken when an inspector of
dead letters was appointed to “examine all dead letters at
the expiration of each quarter; to communicate to Congress
such letters as contain inimical schemes or intelligence; to
preserve carefully all money, loan office certificates, lottery
tickets, notes of hand, and other valuable papers enclosed
in any of them, and be accountable” for their safekeeping,
subject to the restriction that he take “no copy of any letter
whatever,” and refuse “to divulge their contents to any but
Congress or those whom they may appoint for the purpose.”<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Articles of Confederation had been agreed
upon and submitted to the states. There was no objection
to a grant of the postal power, but the terms in which it
was made limited its extent. Part of Article XVIII in the
first draft gave the United States “the sole and exclusive
right and power of ... establishing and regulating postoffices
throughout all the United Colonies, on lines of communication
from one colony to another,” and later on in
the same article, it was provided that the United States
“shall never impose or levy any taxes or duties except in
managing the postoffice.”<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> In the second draft, the grant
was made more limited; it gave Congress “the sole and exclusive
right and power ... of establishing and regulating
postoffices from one state to another throughout all the
United States and exacting such postage on the papers passing
through the same as may be requisite to defray the
expenses of said office.” In this form the clause became
part of the Articles of Confederation as adopted by the
states,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> and there was no further discussion of the power,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
negative action being taken on the motion of the Pennsylvania
delegates (June 25, 1778) “that such part of the 9th
article as respects the postoffice, be altered or amended so
as that Congress be obliged to lay the accounts annually
before the legislatures of the several states.”<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>The Articles of Confederation gave the limited power of
establishing and regulating postoffices “from one state to
another.” Thus, intrastate postal facilities were beyond
the purview of Congress; nothing was said, moreover,
about the establishment of postroads, or the opening up of
new routes, and the sole power of taxation granted to Congress
was confined to an amount sufficient to defray the
expenses of the system. Nevertheless, the inadequacy of
the grant was theoretical rather than real, since Congress
was so occupied with other more pressing affairs, that it was
content with a limited communication of intelligence, desiring
solely that this be as speedy and secure as possible.</p>

<p>From this time on references to the postal establishment
in the congressional journals are of frequent occurrence;
additional investigating committees were established and
the personnel of the standing committee was changed. Expenses
grew apace while the revenues diminished and this
called for measures of retrenchment. A resolution of December
27, 1779, contained the regulation that “the post
shall set out and arrive at the place where Congress shall be
sitting twice in every week,” and it was at the same time
urged that “the whole expensive system of express riding
be totally abolished except by the particular order of Congress
upon very special occasions.”<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>On October 18, 1782, under the power granted by the
Articles of Confederation, there was passed “An Ordinance
for Regulating the Post-Office of the United States of
America.” For the period it was a most elaborate statute
and marks the birth of a real postal establishment. Of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
comprehensiveness was the act that when, ten years later,
Congress passed legislation under the authority delegated
by the Constitution, the Ordinance was merely amplified.
Its preamble recited:</p>

<p>“Whereas the communication of intelligence with regularity
and dispatch from one part to another of these United
States is essentially requisite to the safety as well as the
commercial interest thereof; and the United States in Congress
assembled being by the Articles of Confederation
vested with the sole and exclusive right and power of establishing
and regulating postoffices throughout all these United
States; and whereas it is become necessary to revise the
several regulations heretofore made relating to the postoffice
and reduce to one act:</p>

<p>“Be it therefore ordained by the United States in Congress
assembled, and it is hereby ordained by the authority
of the same, that a continued communication of posts
throughout these United States shall be established and
maintained by and under the direction of the postmaster
general of these United States to extend to and from the
state of New Hampshire to the state of Georgia inclusive,
and to and from such other parts of the United States as
from time to time he shall judge necessary or Congress
shall direct.”<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>The duties of the postmaster general were “to superintend
and direct the postoffice in all its various departments and
services ... agreeably to the rules and regulations” of the
ordinance. He was given the power to appoint an assistant
and deputies, for whom he should be responsible; to station
them, and to fix their commissions, with a maximum limit
of 20 per cent. on money “to arise from postage in their
respective departments.” He was given the further power
of appointing postriders, messengers and expresses.</p>

<p>In this ordinance, moreover, Congress attempted to lay
down certain regulations, infraction of which would be
punishable, although not criminally or in an efficient manner.
All persons in the service were forbidden knowingly or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
wilfully “to open, detain, delay, secrete, embezzle, or destroy,
or cause, procure, permit, or suffer to be opened,
detained, delayed, secreted, embezzled or destroyed, any
letter or letters, packet or packets, or other dispatch or dispatches,
which shall come into his power, hands, or custody,
by reason of his employment in, or relation to, the postoffice,
except by the consent of the person or persons by or
to whom the same shall be delivered or directed, or by an
express warrant under the hand of the president of the
Congress of these United States or in time of war, of the
commander in chief of the armies of these United States,
or of the chief executive officer of one of the said states,
for that purpose, or except in such other cases wherein he
shall be authorized to do so by this ordinance.”</p>

<p>All persons in the postal service were required, antecedent
to their employment, to take an oath promising to carry out
and obey these meticulous provisions to safeguard the mails,
but the method of enforcement was ineffective. Congress
provided that “if the postmaster general shall be guilty of
the said oath or affirmation or any part thereof, and be
thereof convict, he shall forfeit and pay 1,000 dollars in an
action of debt in the state where the offense shall be committed,
by the treasurer of the United States for the time
being.” The penalty for other employees was $300, but all
were “rendered incapable ever hereafter of holding any
office or place of trust or profit under these United States.”<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>In order to make probable a higher degree of efficiency
and to insure adequate revenues, the Congress attempted to
make and enforce a monopoly. The Ordinance specified
that the postmaster and his assistants, but “no other person
whatsoever shall have the receiving, taking up, ordering,
dispatching ... carrying and delivering of any letters,
packets or other dispatches, from any place within these
United States for hire, reward, or other profit or advantage
... and any such person or persons presuming to do so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
shall forfeit and pay for every such offense, 20 dollars, to
be sued for and recovered in an action of debt with costs of
the suit.” Persons on private missions were exempted and
private cross posts could be established with the approval
of the postmaster general. By the ordinance rates were
fixed and special provisions were made for newspapers
which were to be carried “at such moderate rates as the
postmaster general shall establish.” The franking privilege,
finally, was extended to the officials at Washington
and single letters could be sent without postage to officers
of the line in actual service; by early amendments to the
ordinance there were further extensions, Washington was
relieved of paying postage and allowance was made for
ministers at foreign courts.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>The incompleteness of the national control over the postoffice
and in particular the inadequacy of the device that
really criminal offenses should be punished by civil suits,
were shown in January, 1784 when Congress considered a
robbery which had taken place at Princeton. The mail had
been carried off and some days later was found in a meadow,
several letters having been lost and several more, franked
by members of Congress, having been broken open. The
“supreme executive of the state of New Jersey” was requested
to undertake an investigation to discover those
guilty, but when his reply exculpated the Princeton postmaster
“from every suspicion of collusion or fraud” the
inquiry was dropped. Congress could proceed no further.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>Another incident showing general acceptance of the fact
that the regulation of the mails and the punishment of
offenses against them should be under plenary national
control, occurred a few months later and was considered by
the Committee of the States during a recess of Congress.
An investigating committee reported that an advertisement
of French packet boats was “an open avowal of an intention
to contravene an ordinance of Congress for regulating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
the postoffice of these United States; and that the measures
therein mentioned ... are a flagrant violation of the same
ordinance ... will greatly injure the revenue of the postoffice,
and, if not prevented, may defeat that useful institution.”
The Committee of the States agreed to the report and
directed that if the postmaster general should determine
that the ordinance had been violated, he should cause the
prosecution of the offenders according to law, namely, make
them defendants in actions of debt for the penalties provided
by the ordinance.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>On September 4, the postmaster general was given authority
to contract for the conveyance of the mails by stage
carriages, if practicable, for one year, but on the part of
some of the states considerable opposition developed. A
motion was made to construe the words “if practicable” as
not binding the postoffice “to form the contract for the
transportation of the mail on terms inconvenient to the
mercantile interest, or to comply with the extravagant demands
of the contractors,” but the vote was in the negative
and a second attempt to modify the original instruction was
also unsuccessful.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> The later motion showed a disposition
on the part of the states to desire flexible national regulations,
which would not necessarily be uniform, but would
be adapted to local needs. The resolution recited that in
respect to the states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
Maryland and Virginia, the mails might “be carried
upon more reasonable and convenient terms should the postmaster
general be left at liberty to contract for the same
either by stage carriages or postriders, as shall appear to
him most conducive to the public interest.</p>

<p>“And whereas the intention of Congress in having the
mail transported by stage carriages was not only to render
their conveyance more certain and secure, but by encouraging
the establishment of stages to make intercourse between
different parts of the union less difficult and expensive than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
formerly; and as a discretionary power in the postmaster
general either to employ postriders or contract with the
owners of stage carriages for conveying the mail in the
states of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia
might interfere with the object of promoting and establishing
the running of stages in said states, Resolved, that so
far as respects these states it is improper to alter the postmaster
general’s present instructions.”<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> Thus very early
attempts were made to secure special local facilities.</p>

<p>During this period, however, subsequent to the ordinance
of 1782, Congress took no important action in regard to the
postoffice. It annually gave the postmaster general authority
to contract for the succeeding year, and to encourage the
useful institution of the postoffice when it could be done
without material injury to the public.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> In the enforcement
of federal regulations, as has been said, the government was
limited by having to sue in actions of debt, and so it was a
foregone conclusion that the postal power, inadequately
vested in Congress under the Articles of Confederation,
would be one of the grants contained in the Constitution.
The Pinckney plan as it was submitted to the Committee of
Detail, mentioned “establishing Post-Offices” as one of the
exclusive powers of “the Senate and House of Delegates
in Congress assembled.”<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> Pinckney’s original draft outlined
the power as that “of establishing Post-Offices and
raising a revenue from them.”<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>In the Convention Mr. Paterson on June 15, 1787 suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
“that in addition to the power vested in the United
States by the existing articles of Confederation, they be
authorized to pass acts for raising a revenue, ... by a postage
on all letters and packages passing through the general
postoffice, to be applied to such federal purposes as they
shall deem proper and expedient.”<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> The report of the
Committee of Detail was made to the Convention on August
6 and provided (Art. VII) that “The Legislature of the
United States shall have the power ... to establish postoffices.”<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>Ten days later, the Committee’s report being under consideration
it was proposed that the words “and postroads”
be added. This was carried by a close vote, though it is
difficult to attribute the opposition to any source other than
a general fear of giving the federal government too much
power and thus endangering the chances for adoption.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>
To this feeling also, may be ascribed the result that, when,
later, some urged the insertion of an additional grant “to
regulate stages on the post roads,” the proposal was not
reported from the Committee of Detail.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> Such a power
has, however, been fully exercised.</p>

<p>The report of the Committee of Style, made on September
12, fixed the grant as that “to establish postoffices and postroads,”
this being the form in which it became a part of the
Constitution.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> Dr. Franklin, however, advocated that
there be added “a power to provide for cutting canals where
deemed necessary.”<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> The motion was seconded, but Mr.
Sherman started the opposition by objecting on the ground
that the “expense in such cases will fall on the United
States and the benefits accrue to the places where the canals
may be cut.” Mr. Wilson, on the contrary, argued that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>instead of being an expense to the United States, the canals
might be made a source of revenue, and Madison wanted
“an enlargement of the motion into a power to grant
charters of incorporation where the interest of the United
States might require, and the legislative provisions of the
individual states might be incompetent. His primary object,
however, was to secure an easy communication between the
states which the free intercourse, now to be opened, seemed
to call for. The political obstacles being removed, a removal
of the natural ones as far as possible ought to follow.”<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>
The question, however, was limited to the single
case of canals, and when put to a vote was defeated, because
there was an antipathy to monopolies,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> and because, as
Gouverneur Morris admitted, “It was extremely doubtful
whether the Constitution they were framing could ever be
passed at all by the people of America; that to give it its
best chance, however, they should make it as palatable as
possible, and put nothing into it, not very essential, which
might raise up enemies.”<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>This history of the postal clause in the Federal Convention
offers little of interpretative importance. The intent of the
framers is sufficiently clear, although, as pointed out by one
commentator, the delegation is clothed in words which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
“poorly express its object” and “feebly indicate the particular
measures which may be adopted to carry out its
design. To establish post offices and post roads is the form
of the grant; to create and regulate the entire postal system
of the Government is the evident intent.”<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>It is possible partially to explain the specific negativing of
the power to cut canals on the ground that there was no
limitation to those cases in which the construction would
have been an aid to interstate commerce or the transportation
of the mails. Under the amendment as proposed Congress
would have had the authority to cut a waterway
wholly within a state for purely intrastate purposes.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> As
a matter of fact, however, this power, which later was to
give rise to considerable controversy, has been exercised by
the federal government under its authority to regulate interstate
commerce and establish postroads, just as the postal
grant itself has been extended to cover fields, neither existing
nor within the range of possibility when the Constitution
was adopted.</p>

<p>In the state conventions there was practically no discussion
of the postal power. Its innocuousness was granted.
Mr. Jones of New York was alone in finding a latent aggression,
and it was resolved, as the opinion of the state
committee, “that the power of Congress to establish post-offices
and postroads is not to be construed to extend to the
laying out, making, altering, or repairing highways, in any
state, without the consent of the legislature of such state.”<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>
Such a stipulation was destined very soon to become a mere
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">brutum fulmen</i>.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p id="eof"><i>Expansion of Facilities.</i>&mdash;“Our whole economic, social
and political system,” says President Hadley, “has become
so dependent upon free and secure postal communication,
that the attempt to measure its specific effects can be little
less than a waste of words.”<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> This is hardly an overstatement
of the case, yet, as we have seen, the importance of the
postal function was recognized before the Constitution was
adopted and when it comprehended only the transmission of
intelligence. The increased importance, however, has been
absolute as well as relative, since through the postoffice the
government now does much more than merely facilitate
communication between its citizens.</p>

<p>An act for the temporary establishment of the postoffice
was passed by Congress on September 22, 1789.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> It provided
for the appointment of a postmaster general, all the
details and regulations to be as they “were under the resolutions
and ordinances of the late Congress. The postmaster
general to be subject to the direction of the president of the
United States, in performing the duties of his office, and in
forming contracts for the transportation of the mail.”<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>For a considerable period congressional and administrative
efforts were devoted almost exclusively to the extension
of facilities; postoffices were established as rapidly as possible;
every effort was made to secure speedy transportation
of the mail, to insure its security, to prevent private competition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
and by means of an increasingly efficient system to weld
together distant parts of the country. The communications
of the postmasters general are devoted to recommendations
for the improvement of the service;<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> presidential messages
take pride in reporting the growth of the establishment,
which was rapid. In 1790 there were about 100 postoffices
in the country; the receipts from October, 1790 to October,
1791 were $31,706.27 and the disbursements left a balance
of $5,498.51.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>But in 1823 Monroe was able to report to Congress that
88,600 miles of postroads had been established by law and
that the mail was transported over 85,700 miles of this total.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
During the two years from July 1, 1823 the increase of the
transportation of the mail exceeded 1,500,000 miles annually
and 1,040 new postoffices were established.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> In 1828 the
total mileage was 114,536 as compared with 5,642 in 1792
and in 1837 was 142,877 miles.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> The receipts from postage
for the year ending March 31, 1828 were $1,058,204.34.
These figures serve, in some measure at least, to indicate the
rapid expansion of the postal system.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>At the same time there was a commensurate recognition
of the importance of the establishment in the attitude of
Congress and the executive in dealing with it as an administrative
arm of the federal government. The act of 1810
referred to the “postoffice establishment”; an incidental
use of the word “department” is to be found in the laws of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
1799 and 1810,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> but the system became an executive department
in 1872 when Congress, codifying the postal laws,
passed an act under which the department is now organized.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>
In 1827 the postmaster general’s salary was increased
to $6,000 per annum, and he was thus placed on an
equality with cabinet officers; two years later Jackson made
him a member of his official family.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>Later in this essay will be found a consideration of the use
made by Congress of the postroads clause,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> in the assumption
of authority to aid in works of internal improvement,
but here some mention should be made of the connection
which has existed between the desire for a speedy transportation
of the mail and aid granted to railroads. This
aid took the form of donations, with mail service free or at
reasonable rates, loans to companies, and general contracts
for service, with the purpose of giving aid as well as paying
compensation.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> In debating the desirability of governmental
stock subscriptions in transportation undertakings
Congress often adverted to the carriage of the mails; and in
1834 it was proposed to give the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
Company $320,000 in return for which the mail was to
be carried free forever.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> Similar suggestions were made
from time to time, but there was little definite action, and
in 1845 the postmaster general was authorized to contract
for the transportation of the mail by railroads, without inviting
bids.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p>Since 1850 the postoffice has not been used, at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
avowedly, to aid railways; the period has rather been one of
regulation. Disputes have arisen over the proper compensation
for service rendered, and companies have refused to
give facilities for transportation.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> It was proposed, therefore,
that the roads be forced to carry the mails, and in
1870 an act to this effect was applied in the District of
Columbia, compensation to be determined by three commissioners.
But in 1872,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> the codification of the postal laws
provided rates for service, with compulsory service by the
roads which had received land grants; if the companies
were not satisfied with the amounts fixed by Congress,
letters were to be forwarded by horse, and the articles for
which expedition was not required, were to be sent by
stage.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> At present compensation is determined by an
elaborate system, under maximum rates fixed by Congress.
The postmaster general may make reductions for refusal to
transport, when required, upon the fastest trains,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> and may
impose fines for inefficient service and delays.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> The necessity
has not arisen, but if the railways should refuse to carry
the mails, on the ground of inadequate compensation, Congress
would have the right to compel transportation, upon
reasonable compensation for the taking of private property
for public use.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>This, however, is only one phase of the financial problem
of the postoffice; another, very important phase involves the
cost to patrons. Rates for the transmission of letters remained
practically unaltered until 1845, while the charges
for newspapers were slightly changed in the direction of
allowing the publishers special privileges. The act of
1845<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> exercised a broad authority of classification, separating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
the mail in order to expedite it, and introducing the free
privilege for newspapers not more than 1,900 square inches
in size, distributed within 30 miles of the place of printing.
The act of 1847<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> allowed free exchanges only between publishers,
and following this statute many changes were made,
both in the conditions of exemption from postage and the
rates which were charged. The classification now obtaining
was adopted in 1879,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> and the cent a pound rate for
periodical matter admitted to “second class” privileges was
fixed in 1885.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>But while concessions were made to encourage the circulation
of newspapers, Congress maintained rigid restrictions in
respect to the size of the packages that could be carried in
the mails. The limit was three, and later four pounds.
This was originally due to the fact that large packages could
not be handled with convenience by the system and were
likely to injure or deface other mail matter. But when
federal facilities became sufficient to take off, or at least
raise, the weight limit, the express companies, which at this
time were beginning to derive a large revenue from carrying
parcels, were able to postpone congressional action until
August 24, 1912<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> when the Parcels Post Act was passed
after it had been repeatedly recommended by postmasters
general and long desired by public opinion.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> Such delay
has, of course, not been without bitter criticism,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
the forties the rise of the express companies, and their
transportation of large packets and in some cases of matter
which the postoffice undertook to carry, reduced federal
revenues and seriously interfered with the efficiency and
effectiveness of the government monopoly.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> But at any
time the situation could have been remedied by congressional
action. On the other hand, objection has been made to the
assumption by Congress under the postoffice clause, of the
functions of a common carrier, on the ground that they were
not comprehended by the original grant.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>Now, Congress clearly has the power to insure, upon the
payment of extra fees, the safe transmission of letters or
packets to the addressees, but the postal money order system
cannot be justified upon any such theory. The act of May
17, 1864<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> authorized the postmaster general to establish,
“under such rules and regulations as he may find expedient
and necessary, a uniform money order system at all post-offices
which he may deem suitable therefor.” The law
fixed thirty dollars as the maximum amount for which an
order could be issued, the purpose of the system being to
afford “a cheap, immediate and safe agency for the transfer
through the mails of small sums of money.”<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> In practice
the payee or party for whom the money was intended, was
not named in the order, which was given to the applicant
upon the payment of the sum specified and the proper fee,
and his filling out a printed form of application. This was
forwarded to the postmaster at the office upon which the
order was drawn, and the latter, therefore, had the information
necessary to detect fraud if any was attempted. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
issue of these postal notes was discontinued in 1894,<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a>
although their use has since been urged;<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> under the money
order system as it now obtains, the payee is named in the
instrument.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<p>In the Senate there was no debate other than on the
administrative features of the law of 1864;<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> the constitutional
question was not discussed. Some doubt, however,
has since been expressed as to the power of Congress to
establish a system of postal savings banks. These were,
according to the title of the act, to hold “savings at interest
with the security of the government for repayment thereof,
and for other purposes.” It was provided that available
funds should be used in the redemption of United States
bonds, and the act recited, “that the faith of the United
States is solemnly pledged to the payment of the deposits
made in the postal savings depository offices, with accrued
interest thereof, as herein provided.” This section would
seem to imply that the receiving of deposits could be considered
as borrowing money on the credit of the United
States.</p>

<p>Objection, upon constitutional grounds, was, however,
made by Mr. Moon of Tennessee, in a minority report which
he presented to the House of Representatives.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> He argued
that no express authority could be found in the Constitution,
and that “the depository is not a bank within the legal
meaning of that word; nor do the trustees created by this
act collect money (deposits) from the people for governmental
purposes, but simply become federal trustees of
private funds for loan or reinvestment at interest.”</p>

<p>It would seem, however, that the provision for redeeming
United States bonds and the general tenor of the law, could,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
without violence, enable the system to be looked upon as
established for the purpose of borrowing money on the credit
of the United States, or of obviating in some degree the
issuance of emergency currency in financial crises through
the deposit with the government, and subsequent circulation,
of large sums of money which has hitherto been hoarded.
But apart from this, while extensions of the postal function
to include banking facilities for the receipt of deposits
and the issuance of money orders, were certainly not contemplated
by the framers of the Constitution, and are not
connected with the transmission of intelligence, they are,
from foreign precedent, logical parts of the modern postal
power. It is extremely difficult, moreover, for a citizen to
show an amount of interest sufficient to bring before the
courts the constitutionality of such non-essential functions
of the government.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> And especially is this the case when
their exercise does not entail taxation, but actually results in
increased revenues, and interferes slightly if at all, with the
exercise of the same functions by private undertakings.
Finally, it should be remembered that the powers granted
in the postal clause “are not confined to the instrumentalities
of commerce, or the postal service known or in use
when the Constitution was adopted, but they keep pace with
the progress of the country, and adapt themselves to the
new developments of time and circumstances.”<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> According
to this view there is no constitutional doubt as to the
right of the postoffice to engage in the banking activities
thus far attempted.</p>

<p id="ca"><i>Collectivist Activities.</i>&mdash;The primary purpose of the postal
power is, of course, the transmission of intelligence, but with
vast equipment and organization once in existence, it is a
comparatively simple matter for the government to increase
in number and in kind, the services which the postoffice
may perform for its patrons. In New Zealand postoffices,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
for example, a person can buy stamps, mail a letter or
parcel, send a telegram, deposit money, collect a pension,
report births and deaths, and insure his life.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p>It is due, in part, at least, to the federal system of government
in the United States that Congress has been reluctant
to increase the functions of the postoffice. But the money
order system and postal savings banks have now been established,
and it seems inevitable that the telegraph and telephone
systems of the country will shortly be nationalized.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a>
So also rural free delivery has caused congressional aid to
be given to the good roads movement and several schemes
have been proposed for extensive road construction under
federal auspices.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p>The inauguration of the parcel post, which in fact has
made the postoffice a common carrier, has led to serious
efforts on the part of the government towards an adequate
appreciation, by possible users, of the advantages of the new
facilities, and a campaign of education is carried on, not so
much with a view of increasing revenues, as of fostering
the “producer to consumer” movement, particularly in
farm products. Congress authorized the Secretary of Agriculture
“to acquire and diffuse among the people of the
United States useful information on subjects connected with
the marketing and distributing of farm products” and under
this authority the Office of Markets was established on May
16, 1913.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> It employs specialists in marketing various commodities,
and issues bulletins on the facilities for, and advantages
of, shipping different products by parcel post.
Agents are sent to appropriate sections of the country to do
personal work and local offices are active in collecting lists
of the names of farmers and others who have produce to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
sell, and printing and distributing these lists to postal patrons
who may become purchasers.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>It is proposed, furthermore, to use postoffices as employment
bureaus, and a bill, the adoption of which was strongly
urged on the Sixty-third Congress by Senator Clapp, provided
that the postmaster general establish, “under such
rules and regulations as he may prescribe, mutual employment
exchanges at all presidential postoffices, where registers
may be kept of any and all persons who make application to
be registered, as either seeking employment, or seeking employees,
which information may also be exchanged between
such offices, all in the interest of the proper and timely distribution
of labor throughout the country.”<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> This service
would be made self-sustaining through the sale of registration
stamps. The bill failed of passage.</p>

<p>But pending action of this character, or the adoption by
Congress of legislation designed to lessen unemployment
without using the postoffice, the Secretary of Labor and
the Postmaster General, cooperated in formulating an arrangement
by which “information relating to the distribution
of labor could be widely scattered and posted under the
auspices of the United States Government.</p>

<p>“The plan,” Secretary Wilson goes on to explain, “consists
of dated bulletins sent out by the Department of Labor
to postmasters throughout the country, by whom they are
posted on the bulletin boards so that every postoffice patron,&mdash;and
this means every man, woman and child,&mdash;can easily
refer to the information. These are known as ‘Bulletins of
Opportunities.’ They are replaced with others from time
to time as necessary, and suitable notice is given when they
become inoperative. This plan has received the indorsement
of the various state authorities, who have been, and are,
cooperating with the Department of Labor in scattering information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
about labor opportunities and conditions in their
respective states.”<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p>In collectivist facilities, either at present in existence or
very seriously urged, the American postoffice is, then, not
far behind that of New Zealand. It affords a significant
illustration of the tendency of the federal government
gradually to engage in many activities, properly national,
which are too big for the states, and too expensive or
paternalistic for private undertakings. The aim is that the
maximum benefit may inure to the citizen.</p>

<p id="pc"><i>Postal Crimes.</i>&mdash;The postal power, as Marshall pointed
out in McCulloch v. Maryland,<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> “is executed by the single
act of making the establishment. But from this has been
inferred the power and duty of carrying the mail along the
postroad, from one postoffice to another. And from this
implied power has again been inferred the right to punish
those who steal letters from the postoffice, or rob the mail.
It may be said with some plausibility that the right to carry
the mail and to punish those who rob it is not indispensably
necessary to the establishment of a postoffice and postroad.
The right is indeed essential to the beneficial exercise of
the power, but not indispensably necessary to its existence.”</p>

<p>Such a power was asserted even before the adoption of
the Constitution; the Ordinance of 1782 meticulously forbade
the employees to delay or rob the mails, under penalty
of fines “to be used for and recovered in an action of debt”
by the treasurer of the United States; a supplementary
ordinance attempted to establish a monopoly, and it was
made lawful for the postmaster general “to allow and pay
to any informer, one moiety of the penalties which may be
recovered upon his information, for offences, against the
fourth and fifth clauses of the above mentioned ordinance.”<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<p>The Act of February 20, 1792<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> greatly extended these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
criminal provisions, infraction of which was to be punished
in the federal courts. Some of the penalties provided for
the more serious offences now seem severe, but they are
evidence of how important Congress deemed the inviolability
of the mails. By this act it was provided, “that if any
person shall obstruct or retard the passage of the mail, or
of any horse or carriage carrying the same, he shall, upon
conviction, for every offence pay a fine not exceeding one
hundred dollars. And if any ferryman shall, by wilful
negligence, or refusal to transport the mail across any ferry,
delay the same, he shall forfeit and pay, for each half hour
that the same shall be so delayed, a sum not exceeding ten
dollars.” A fine and disqualification for holding any office
under the United States were the penalties inflicted “if any
deputy postmaster or other person authorized by the postmaster
general to receive the postage of letters, shall fraudulently
demand or receive any rate of postage, or any gratuity
or reward, other than is provided by this act for the postage
of letters or packets.” Vessels were forbidden to enter any
port of the United States and break bulk until their letters
had been delivered to the postmaster, and the officer of the
port could require an oath of delivery. Exception, however,
was made in the case of letters to the owner or
consignee, and when the vessel had letters directed to another
port.</p>

<p>In an effort to make the postal system efficient by insuring
it against private competition and the consequent diminution
of revenues, there was a provision (still in force,
although modified), declaring the federal establishment a
monopoly and making any infringement punishable by a
fine. The act recited “that if any person, other than the
postmaster general or his deputies, or persons by them employed,
shall take up, receive, order, dispatch, carry, convey,
or deliver, any letter or letters, packet or packets, other than
newspapers, for hire or reward, or shall be concerned in
setting up any foot or horse post, wagon or other carriage,
by or in which any letter or packet shall be carried for hire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
on any established postroad, or any packet or other vessel
or boat, or any conveyance whatever, whereby the revenue
of the general postoffice may be injured, every person so
offending shall forfeit for every such offence, the sum of
two hundred dollars.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> <i>Provided</i>, that it shall and may be
lawful for every person to send letters or packets by special
messenger.”</p>

<p>Fine and imprisonment were the punishments for unlawfully
delaying, embezzling, secreting, or destroying any
letter or package not containing money; but if the letter or
packet contained any kind of money, negotiable paper,
bonds, or warrants, the punishment upon conviction was
death. The carrier was forbidden to desert the mail before
he reached his destination; robbing any carrier,<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> the mail,
or the postoffice was punishable by death. Ten dollars was
the penalty for an unlawful use of the franking privilege.
One half of all the fines recovered went to the persons informing
and prosecuting for the offences, and in 1797 it was
provided that accomplices in the commission of postal crimes
should be subject to the same punishment as the principals.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a>
In 1810 whipping was abolished,<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> but the death penalty for
a second robbery, or for putting the carrier’s life in jeopardy,
was continued. This is strong evidence of congressional
insistence upon the sanctity of the mails, since in 1825 only
fine and imprisonment were the punishment for assaults on
the high seas, or within admiralty jurisdiction with intent to
commit a felony.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>Upon the basis of these early regulations, Congress has
passed many laws calculated to prevent interference with the
mails or their misuse; most of the original crimes are still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
forbidden and the changes made have been in detail rather
than character, with one important exception: there has
gradually been built up an <i>Index Expurgatorius</i> of articles
which it is unlawful to deposit in, or to take from, the mails
for purposes of circulation. But with this exception, the
penal laws do not differ radically from those of a century
ago.</p>

<p>Nearly all “Offenses against the Postal Service” have
been brought together as Chapter 8 of the Criminal Code of
the United States.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> It is now unlawful to conduct, or
profess to conduct, a postoffice without authority; to carry
the mail otherwise than according to law; to set up private
expresses; to transport persons unlawfully conveying the
mail; to send letters by private express or for carriers to
convey them over regular post routes otherwise than in the
mail; to wear the uniform of a carrier without authority or
to pose as a carrier of the United States mail when such is
not in fact the case. Injuring mail bags, stealing postoffice
property, stealing or forcing mail locks or keys, breaking
into or entering a postoffice, unlawfully entering a postal
car, stealing, secreting and embezzling mail matter or its
contents,<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> assaulting a carrier with intent to rob and robbing
the mail; injuring letter boxes or mail matter; “knowingly
and wilfully” obstructing or retarding the passage of the
mail, all are crimes punishable in the federal courts.</p>

<p>It is an offence for any employee of the service to detain,
destroy or embezzle a letter or newspaper; for a ferryman to
“delay the passage of the mail by willful neglect or refusal
to transport”; for the master of a vessel to fail to deposit
with the postoffice all mail from abroad or to break bulk
before making such delivery. No one may sell or use a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
cancelled stamp or remove the cancellation marks; postal
employees, moreover, are prohibited from making false returns
to increase their compensation, from unlawfully collecting
postage, from failing to account for postage or to
cancel stamps, and from issuing a money order without
payment.</p>

<p>There are also, as I have indicated, a number of laws
denying the use of the mails for the transmission of obscene
or libellous writings, lottery tickets and advertisements,
fraudulent matter, poisons, intoxicating liquors, explosives
and similar articles which come under the ban of the police
power. Furthermore, the complexity of political life and
more numerous administrative problems in the service, have
given rise to a separate class of offences; thus it is criminal
for a member of Congress to be interested in a public contract,
or a postal employee in a mail contract; or for an
employee to make or receive a political contribution. There
is, finally, the so-called “newspaper publicity law,” the concluding
paragraph of which compels, under penalty of a fine,
the marking as an advertisement of all reading matter for
the publication of which a valuable consideration is received.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></p>

<p>Marshall’s <i>dictum</i> in McCulloch v. Maryland has remained
unquestioned; it has never been doubted that Congress
has the power to punish offences against the mails
themselves, or neglect of duty by postal employees. The
constitutionality of such legislation has never been attacked;
the courts have only been called upon to decide technical
points. For example, the word “rob” is used in its common
law sense; jeopardy “means a well-grounded apprehension
of danger to life, in case of refusal or resistance”;
pistols are dangerous weapons within the meaning of the
law; and “all persons present at the commission of a crime,
consenting thereto, aiding, assisting, or abetting therein, or
in doing any act which is a constituent of the offence, are
principals.”<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> The detention of mail by one employed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
the postoffice, refers to a letter or packet before it reaches
its destination; the taking must be clandestine and the intent
criminal.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> An indictment for advising a carrier to rob the
mail must aver that the offence has been committed;<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> a
sword in the hand, although not drawn, is a dangerous
weapon; a pistol is presumed to be charged.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> These are
some of the questions that the courts have been called upon
to determine.</p>

<p>Nor has there been any dispute as to the power of Congress
to establish a monopoly by forbidding private postal
enterprises.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> As was pointed out in an early case, “No
government has ever organized a system of posts without
securing to itself, to some extent, a monopoly of the carriage
of letters and mailable packets. The policy of such an exclusive
system is a subject of legislative, not of judicial
inquiry. But the monopoly of the government is an optional,
not an essential part of its postal system. The mere
existence of a postal department of the government is not an
establishment of the monopoly.”<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> Thus questions have
arisen as to the extent and scope of the original provision
and the amendments that have been made to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
In 1834, for example, New Orleans citizens complained of
slow mails, and proposed a plan of forming a private association
for a daily express line to New York. But the project
being referred to Chancellor Kent for his opinion, he
advised that “the objects of the association cannot be carried
into effect, in the way proposed, without violating the postoffice
law.”<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> In 1844 the Attorney General gave an opinion
that letters carried over mail routes by private carriers
could not be charged with postage, nor could the letters be
detained; the only available course was “to enforce the
penalties to which all unauthorized carriers of letters on the
mail routes are by law subjected.”<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p>As for the general interpretation of the statute, a federal
circuit court, in holding that it was not unlawful to carry
an unstamped letter of advice concerning money shipped by
express, said: “These provisions of the postoffice law, being
in derogation of common right, must be construed strictly,
and in the absence of clear and explicit language, forbidding
the carriage of a letter, under the circumstances indicated,
we must hold that the right to do so is not interfered with.”<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>
The Supreme Court of the United States, however, had
previously declared that the act was undoubtedly a revenue
law,<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> although “not drawn with all the precision and explicitness
desirable in penal legislation.” And the rule of
interpretation as laid down by the Department of Justice
was that the acts “are not subjected to the narrow rules
formerly applied in the construction of penal statutes....
In our courts, such acts receive the same construction that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
would be put upon any other remedial legislation; that is, a
fair, sensible, practical interpretation, without reference to
any merely technical rule in favor of the accused.”<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>

<p>The question arose in 1858 as to the legality of carrying
letters to and from the postoffice in a town where a public
carrier had not been appointed. The attorney general was
of the opinion that the act forbade this. “A person,” he
said, “who intends to make the carrying of letters his
regular business, or part of his business, and to do it
periodically for hire, in opposition to the public carrier, is
legally incapable of receiving authority to take letters out of
the postoffice for that purpose.”<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> But when the question
went to the courts, a contrary position was taken. The Act
of March 3, 1851<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> authorized the postmaster general “to
establish postroutes within the cities or towns.” The court
held that the word “postroutes” was not synonymous with
“postroads” used in that portion of the act of 1827 which
made criminal attempts to compete with the federal government
in carrying the mail. Hence private letter carriers
violated no law. This decision,<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> however, was overruled
when Congress extended<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> the provisions of the Act of 1827
to all postroutes already, or thereafter established, and in
1872<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> declared letter carrier routes within cities “postroads.”<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Thus when an express company had a number of messengers
to collect letters daily from certain customers who
paid with private stamps, previously sold, the letters being
taken to an office, sorted, and dispatched to the addressees,
the court held that these deliveries could not be deemed “by
messenger employed for the particular occasion only,” but
were deliveries “by regular trips and at stated periods,” and
the defendant was therefore liable.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>There has always been the exception that the carrier is
permitted to transport, otherwise than in the mail, letters or
packets relating “to some part of the cargo of such steamboat
or other vessel, <i>to the current business of the carrier</i>,
or to some article” carried at the same time.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> Under this
inhibition it is not lawful for a railroad company to carry
letters from one connecting line to another line, when the
letters relate to through business. The letters must be sent
by, or addressed to, the carrying company.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> But in 1912
Attorney General Wickersham decided that a railroad might
carry over its lines, not in the mail, letters written by the
secretary of a relief association (which was composed of the
employees of the railroad) to the railroad company, but not
letters from the officers of the association to its members.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></p>

<p>In 1915 the Supreme Court was called upon to construe
the statute and held within the “current business” exception
“letters of a telegraph superintendent, jointly appointed and
paid by a railway company, and a telegraph company, which
were written to a railway station agent and telegraph
operator with the purpose of promoting the efficient and
successful operation of the telegraph business in the success
of which the railway company, under the contract with the
telegraph company, has a financial interest.” The Court
refused, however, to consider whether the statute is “penal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
or remedial, or whether it is to have a strict or a liberal
interpretation.”<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<p>Another class of offences has arisen out of the section
providing punishment for “whoever shall knowingly and
wilfully obstruct or retard the passage of the mail,” or any
conveyance by which it is being carried. Wide extension of
federal authority and effective federal supremacy have been
enforced under this provision, it having been held that a
defendant toll gate keeper cannot plead the justification of
a state law for stopping a carrier of the mail.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> It has been
decided, also, that mail matter in the postoffice, ready for
delivery, is “obstructed” within the meaning of the
statute by an unprovoked assault on the postmaster. “The
law presumes that the defendant intended by his act the
result which followed and the offense is complete.” An act,
if unlawful, resulting in an obstruction, is <i>per se</i> done knowingly
and wilfully.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></p>

<p>Preventing a mail train from running as made up, even
though one is willing that the mail car shall go on, is an
obstruction within the meaning of the statute,<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> and where
the regular passenger trains of a railroad company have
been selected as the ones to carry the mail, the failure of the
railroad to run other trains for that purpose is not necessarily
unlawful.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> It is no defense, however, that the obstruction
was effected merely by leaving the employment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
“where the motive of quitting was to retard the mails, and
had nothing to do with the terms of employment.”<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></p>

<p>These doctrines were given their widest scope in the Debs
cases. It was held that an indictment for obstructing the
mails need not set out that the act was done feloniously,
since the crime was not a felony at the common law; nor,
furthermore, is it necessary to show knowledge that the
mails would be interfered with. “The laws make all railways
postroutes of the United States,” said the court, “and
it is within the range of everyone’s knowledge that a large
proportion of the passenger trains on these roads carry the
mails.” Finally where the indictment is for conspiracy to
obstruct the mails, and overt acts in pursuance thereof, “it
is not restricted to a single overt act, since the gist of the
offense is conspiracy, which is a single offense.”<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></p>

<p>The authority of Congress may, moreover, be enforced
otherwise than by prosecution for violations of this provision.
“The entire strength of the nation,” said the Supreme
Court, “may be used to enforce in any part of the land the
full and free exercise of all national powers and the security
of all rights entrusted by the Constitution to its care. The
strong arm of the national government may be put forth to
brush away all obstructions to the freedom of interstate commerce
or the transportation of the mails. If the emergency
arises the army of the Nation, and all its militia, are at the
service of the Nation to compel obedience to its laws.” And
the Supreme Court went on to declare that “it is equally
within its [the federal government’s] competency to appeal
to the civil courts for an inquiry and determination as to the
existence and character of any alleged obstructions, and if
such are found to exist, or threaten to occur, to invoke the
powers of those courts to remove or restrain such obstructions;
that the jurisdiction of the courts to interfere in such
matters by injunction is one recognized from ancient times
and by indubitable authority; ... that the proceeding by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
injunction is of a civil character and may be enforced by
proceedings in contempt; that such proceedings are not in
execution of the criminal laws of the land; that the penalty
for a violation of the injunction is no substitute for and no
defence to a prosecution for any criminal offences committed
in the course of such violation.”<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p>When we turn, however, to the power of Congress to
exclude from the mails, a different problem is presented.
As has been pointed out, early in the history of the postoffice,
mail matter was classified according to its character and
different rates of postage were charged. In 1799 the Postmaster
General sent a letter to Congress complaining of
“large and inconvenient packages” and the Act of 1810
provided that “no postmaster shall be obliged to receive,
to be conveyed by mail, any packet which shall weigh more
than three pounds.”<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> Congress, therefore, very early exercised
the right of determining what articles should be mailable
and the conditions upon which they should be carried.</p>

<p>These exclusions were made to protect the mails. Objection
was made to the “inconvenient packages” on the
ground that the transit was retarded and smaller articles were
injured. Such restrictions have been maintained, the postoffice
regulations now prescribing the limits, both of weight
and size. Congress has, moreover, on the same ground,
conditionally excluded a variety of articles, such as poisons,
explosives, inflammable materials, infernal machines, disease
germs, and all compositions liable to hurt anyone or
injure the mails. It is provided, however, that the postmaster
general “may permit the transmission in the mails
under such rules and regulations as he shall prescribe
as to preparation and packing” of any of these articles,
“not outwardly or of their own force dangerous or injurious
to life, health and property.” Intoxicating liquors
are absolutely excluded. Any violations of the statutory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
provisions or of regulations made by the postmaster general
in pursuance of the authority given him, are punishable by
fine and imprisonment.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></p>

<p>The absolute exclusion of intoxicants, however, cannot be
justified upon the same principles as the conditional exclusions,
since the danger to the mails can only arise from
the fact that they are liquids. This distinction leads
naturally to another class of articles which are denied postal
facilities on account of the effect they will have on recipients.
In this class is all printed or written matter which is obscene,
libellous and indecent, or which relates to lotteries and
fraudulent schemes.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></p>

<p>The first inhibition was made by Congress in the Act of
March 3, 1865, and by the Act of June 8, 1872, codifying
previous laws and organizing the postoffice on its present
basis, the use of the mails was denied to obscene matter,
cards “upon which scurrilous epithets may have been written
or printed, or disloyal devices printed or engraved” and
“letters or circulars concerning illegal lotteries.”<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> It has
since been made criminal to take obscene or scurrilous
matter from the mails for purposes of circulation.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></p>

<p>Before the Supreme Court of the United States, the
power of Congress to exclude obscene and indecent matter
from the mails<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> has never been seriously questioned, and the
points presented for determination, largely to the lower
federal courts, have not been as to the constitutional authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
of Congress.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> In 1890, the Supreme Court held that
under the Act of July 12, 1876 it was not an offence to
deposit in the mails an obscene letter, enclosed in an envelope,
and refused to consider the amendment made in 1888
which had extended the inhibition to sealed matter, closed
to inspection.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> But in 1895, the Court determined that
while the possession of obscene pictures is not forbidden, it
is an offence to deposit in the mails a letter, not in itself objectionable,
but conveying information as to where, and of
whom, such pictures could be obtained.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> And the next
year the Court refused to accept the defence that the obscene
matter was mailed in reply to decoy letters by a government
detective.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></p>

<p>It was held, moreover, that “the words ‘obscene,’ ‘lewd’
and ‘lascivious,’ as used in the statute, signify that form of
immorality which has relation to sexual impurity, and have
the same meaning as is given them at common law in
prosecutions for obscene libel. As the statute is highly
penal, it should not be held to embrace language unless it is
fairly within its letter and spirit.”<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> The penal code of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
1909 extended the language to exclude “every filthy” book,
pamphlet, picture or letter, and this in effect overruled the
Swearingen case.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></p>

<p>There have been questions, also, as to the requirements
for a valid indictment, which, it has been held, need not set
out the objectionable matter, but must inform the accused
of the nature of the charge against him.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> The courts have
varied as to whether the test of obscenity is that laid down
by Lord Cockburn: Is the tendency of the matter “to
deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such
immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of
this sort would fall”?<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> or the dictionary meaning as “offensive
to chastity, decency or delicacy.” The question as to
what is obscene, however, is for the jury to determine.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<p>Congress has also denied postal facilities to “all matter
otherwise mailable by law, upon the envelope or outside
cover or wrapper of which, or any postal card upon which
any delineations, epithets, terms, or language of an indecent,
lewd ... libelous, scurrilous, defamatory, or threatening
character, or calculated by the terms or manner or style of
display and obviously intended to reflect injuriously upon
the character or conduct of another, may be written or
printed or otherwise impressed or apparent.” This prohibition
has been extended to include a postal card demanding
the payment of a debt and stating that “if it is not paid at
once we shall place the same with our lawyer for collection.”<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>It has been held, however, that “outside cover or
wrapper” does not include the outside sheet of a newspaper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
and thus the postal authorities are unable to exclude periodical
publications on the ground that they contain scurrilous
or defamatory matter.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> From time to time bills have been
introduced in Congress to authorize the postmaster general
to exclude from the second-class privilege publications, as
such, single issues of which are found to contain such non-mailable
matter; but no favorable action has ever been taken
by Congress on any of these bills. An effort has also been
made to deny all postal facilities in such cases.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<p>Vigorous objection has been made to the validity of laws
excluding obscene matter, but the arguments have in no case
any authoritative sponsorship. One writer, for example,
urges that “under the pretext of regulating the mails,” Congress
controls “the psycho-sexual condition of the postal
patrons.” “The statute,” he goes on to say, “furnishes no
standard or test by which to differentiate what book is
obscene from that which is not.”<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> Such a contention, so
far as it is one of <i>constitutional weakness</i> in Congress is
plainly invalid. Immoral libels are an offence at the common
law, “not because it is either the duty or province of
the law to promote religion or morality by any direct means
or punishments, but because the line which must be drawn
is between what is and is not the average tone of morality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
which each person is entitled to expect at the hands of his
neighbor as the basis of their mutual dealings.”<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> The
standard to determine what is obscene is the same as that
which has prevailed at the common law.</p>

<p>The right of individuals to use the mails is not an absolute
one; the legislative department of the government may
impose reasonable restrictions on its exercise. It may say
that a public convenience is not to be used to injure the
morals of the citizens and may exclude such injurious matter,
not with the view of making immorality criminal, but simply
in order that the circulation may not be encouraged by the
government. And to make this denial of facilities effective,
Congress may punish violations. The grant of the postal
power (to borrow the language used by the Supreme Court
in a commerce case) “is complete in itself,” and “Congress,
as an incident to it, may adopt not only means necessary
but convenient to its exercise, and the means may have the
quality of police regulations.” The right to use the mails is
“given for beneficial exercise,” and may be denied when it
“is attempted to be perverted to and justify baneful
existence.”<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></p>

<p>With regard to lotteries, however, the case is not so clear.
The law declared that “no letter or circular concerning
[illegal] lotteries, so-called gift concerts, or other similar
enterprises, offering prizes, or concerning schemes devised
and intended to deceive and defraud the public, for the purpose
of obtaining money under false pretenses, shall be
carried in the mail,” and made violation criminal.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> In
1876 the word “illegal” was stricken out, so that letters or
circulars concerning all lotteries were prohibited,<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> and in
1890 the law was further amended so as to include lottery
advertisements in newspapers and to permit postmasters to
withhold suspected mail.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> Trial of offenders may take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
place either in the district where the letter was mailed, or
that to which it was addressed.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>

<p>The Senate Committee in charge of the amendments proposed
in 1890, reported the bill to be based “on the conceded
power of the government to determine what character
of matter may be sent through the mails; and its purpose is
to protect the general welfare and morality of the people
against the pernicious effects of lotteries.”<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> For authority
the committee relied upon the case of Phalen v. Virginia, in
which the Supreme Court said:</p>

<p>“The suppression of nuisances injurious to public health
or morality is among the most important duties of government.
Experience has shown that the common forms of
gambling are comparatively innocuous when placed in contrast
with the widespread pestilence of lotteries. The
former are confined to a few persons and places, but the
latter infests the whole community: it enters every dwelling;
it reaches every class; it preys upon the hard earnings
of the poor; it plunders the ignorant and simple.” At
common law, the committee argued, the king could not
sanction a nuisance; by parity of reasoning a nuisance may
be denied governmental encouragement.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></p>

<p>All of the anti-lottery legislation, enacted by Congress,
has been sustained by the Supreme Court of the United
States, although, I think, the reasoning might well have been
more cogent. In the first case arising under the earlier
legislation, the Court declared:</p>

<p>“The validity of legislation prescribing what should be
carried, and its weight and form and the charges to which it
should be subjected, has never been questioned.... The
power possessed by Congress embraces the regulation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
the entire postal system of the country. The right to
designate what shall be carried necessarily involves the right
to determine what shall be excluded.”<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> And in a later
case, under the act of 1890, the freedom of the press also
being at issue, the Court said:</p>

<p>“The states before the Union was formed could establish
postoffices and postroads and in doing so could bring into
play the police power in the protection of their citizens from
the use of the means so provided for purposes supposed to
exert a demoralizing influence upon the people. When the
power to establish postoffices and postroads was surrendered
to the Congress it was as a complete power, and the grant
carried with it the right to exercise all the powers which
made that power effective. It is not necessary that Congress
should have the power to deal with crime and immorality
within the states in order to maintain that it possesses the
power to forbid the use of the mails in aid of the perpetration
of crime and immorality.”<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<p>Counsel for the petitioners in this case urged with considerable
force that there was a valid distinction between
obscene or indecent matter and lottery tickets and advertisements,
but to this the Court replied:</p>

<p>“The argument that there is a distinction between <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mala
prohibita</i> and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mala in se</i>, and that Congress might forbid
the use of the mails in promotion of such acts as are universally
regarded as <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mala in se</i>, including all such crimes as
murder, arson, burglary, etc., and the offence of circulating
obscene books and papers, but cannot do so in respect of
other matters which it might regard as criminal or immoral,
but which it has no power itself to prohibit, involves a concession
which is fatal to the contention of the petitioners,
since it would be for Congress to determine what are within
and what are without the rule; but we think there is no room
for such a distinction here, and that it must be left to Congress
in the exercise of a sound discretion to determine in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
what manner it will exercise the power which it undoubtedly
possesses.”</p>

<p>Special exception is taken by Mr. Hannis Taylor to the
doctrines of the Rapier case. He says: “The act against
the circulation of immoral literature, which was not drawn
in a paroxysm of excitement, exhausts the entire constitutional
authority over the intellectual contents of documents
passing through the mails that Congress can exercise.”
And referring to the exclusion of lottery tickets and advertisements:
“This new born heresy&mdash;created to meet a special
emergency&mdash;will be utterly repudiated by the American
people the moment when the despotic and irresponsible
power over opinion with which the fiat of the Supreme
Court has armed Congress, is applied, as it surely will be,
to some subject which will arouse and quicken the public
conscience.”<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></p>

<p>As yet, however, there has been manifested no disposition
to repeal any of the lottery legislation. Congress has, in
fact, made further exclusions, with slight popular protest.
The act of July 31, 1912, excludes from interstate commerce,
from the mails, and from importation into the
United States, “any film or other pictorial representation or
encounter of pugilists, under whatever name, which is designed
to be used or may be used for purposes of public
exhibition.”<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> This, probably, is the most advanced action
yet taken by Congress.</p>

<p>It should be noticed, however, in concluding this review,
that all articles which Congress has thus far excluded from
the mails have been inherently different from the articles
which may be transmitted, in that they may have a harmful
effect on other mail or on recipients. Explosives, liquids, infernal
machines, intoxicating liquors,&mdash;all are in their nature
dangerous to the mail or to the addressees. Obscene literature
and lottery tickets are proper subjects for denunciation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
by the government and Congress may attempt to minimize
their evil by denying them postal facilities. It may be
said, therefore, that all prohibitory legislation has had the
character of police regulations; each exclusion, when assailed,
has been justified on the facts of the particular case,
and the Supreme Court has never gone so far as has a lower
federal tribunal in declaring that, “Congress has exclusive
jurisdiction over the mails and may prohibit the use of the
mails for the transmission of any article. Any article, of
any description, whether harmless or not, may, therefore,
be declared contraband in the mail by act of Congress and
its deposit there made a crime.”<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<p id="fo"><i>Fraud Orders.</i>&mdash;The denial of postal privileges when they
are used to defraud may be justified upon the same grounds
as the exclusion of obscene matter and lottery tickets; Congress
has authority to make the use of the mails subject to
police regulations. But it is provided that “the postmaster
general may, upon evidence satisfactory to him that any
person or company is engaged in conducting any lottery”<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a>
or fraudulent scheme, “instruct postmasters at any postoffice
at which registered letters arrive directed to any such
person or company ... to return all such registered letters
to the postmaster at the office at which they were originally
mailed, with the word ‘Fraudulent’ plainly written or
stamped upon the outside thereof” and they may be returned
to the writers under such regulations as the postmaster
general may prescribe. But under this section there
is no authority to open any sealed letter.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></p>

<p>The constitutionality of these provisions has been fully
established by the Supreme Court of the United States,
which has held that the postal system is not “a necessary
part of the civil government in the same sense in which the
protection of life, liberty and property, the defense of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
government against insurrection, and foreign invasion and
the administration of public justice are; but it is a public
function, assumed and established by Congress for the general
welfare.” Thus it was constitutional to exclude such
fraudulent matter.</p>

<p>As to other objections, the Court declared that due
process of law was not denied when an executive official
was given authority to control the disposition of property;
“nor do we think the law unconstitutional because the postmaster
general may seize and detain all letters, which may
include letters of a purely personal or domestic character,
and having no connection whatever with the prohibited
enterprise.” The fact that the postmaster general may not
open letters not addressed to himself makes such a provision
necessary in order that the law may be effective. Finally,
said the Court, “the objection that the postmaster general is
authorized by statute to confiscate the money, or the representative
of the money, of the addressee, is based upon the
hypothesis that the money or other article of value contained
in a registered letter becomes the property of the
addressee as soon as the letter is deposited in the postoffice.”
But the postmaster general, in seizing the letter, does not
confiscate it, or change title thereto; he merely denies the use
of the facilities of the postoffice. It would be proper for
Congress to empower the postmaster general, in the first
instance, to refuse to receive the letter at all, if its objectionable
character is known to him.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></p>

<p>The sole remaining question is therefore as to the conclusiveness
of administrative determinations and it appears that
in the postoffice cases the courts have exercised their powers
of review further than in any others coming up from different
executive departments.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> The Supreme Court has summarized
the rule as follows: “That where the decision of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
questions of fact is committed by Congress to the judgment
and discretion of the head of a department, his decision
thereon is conclusive; and that even upon mixed questions
of law and fact, or of law alone, his action will carry with
it a strong presumption of its correctness and the courts
will not ordinarily review it, although they may have the
power and will occasionally exercise the right of so doing.”<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></p>

<p>But it is necessary that the facts upon which the administrative
decision is based be not such that the application of
the statute will be a clear mistake of law. Thus, in American
Magnetic School of Healing v. McAnnulty, the postmaster
general in effect made a fraud order depend on his
opinion as to the efficacy of the complainant’s method of
healing by encouraging the proper use of the mind to correct
physical ailments. The court ruled that under no construction
was there evidence sufficient to show fraud. “To
authorize the interference of the postmaster general,” said
the decision, “the facts stated must, in some aspect, be
sufficient to permit him, under the statutes, to make the
order.”<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> Or, expressed differently, if it is “legally impossible”
under any interpretation of the facts, “to hold
that the complaining party was engaged in obtaining money
through the mails by false or fraudulent representations,”
the courts will intervene.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> The general rule may, therefore,
be stated as follows: Judicial review will be granted
only in those cases where it appears that the order is without
legal authority; exercise of discretion will not be reviewed
unless, upon any construction of the facts, the order
is clearly wrong, and even upon questions of law alone, it
will carry a strong presumption of correctness.</p>

<p>A number of proposals have been made and bills introduced
in Congress to provide for a judicial review of the
postmaster general’s decisions. Congressman Crumpacker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
for instance, argued “that in all departments of government
there is no instance where substantial rights are taken from
a citizen upon confidential reports without a legal right to be
heard and to see and examine the evidence that is submitted
against him, aside from the fraud order and practice in the
postoffice department.”<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> He urged that the law should
be changed and a copy of the order served on the concern
suspected of fraudulent practices. This order should not
become operative for fifteen days, except to the extent of
holding the mail undelivered in the postoffice. The aggrieved
party could file a bill in the circuit court with a bond of
$500 and a summary trial at law would be held upon the
issue, which the court should formulate upon the facts involved.
Appeal would lie and pending final action the mail
would be held in the postoffice or disposed of by order of
the court. Another bill authorized a review after the orders
had been issued.</p>

<p>Vigorous objection to such changes in the law was made
by the postoffice authorities. A memorandum filed by the
assistant attorney general for the department<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> declared
that the prime object of the regulations was to secure
summary action. “The value of the law depends upon
the promptness with which schemes to defraud may be
denied the use of the mails to further the swindle. If action
is delayed any considerable time,&mdash;as would necessarily
be the case in a judicial proceeding,&mdash;the scheme will consummate
its fraud before the interference occurs.” If Mr.
Crumpacker’s bill became law, the only effectual action
would be criminal prosecution, and this is always difficult
since the victimized parties live at a distance, and it is hard
to get evidence to offer at the trial.</p>

<p>In practice, the memorandum explained, investigations are
made by inspectors of cases where fraudulent practices are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
alleged, and reports sent to the department. If a <i>prima
facie</i> case of fraud is established, the person or concern involved
is notified and given an opportunity to appear before
the assistant attorney general for the postoffice department;
after the hearing a report is made to the postmaster general
who takes final action. But such a hearing is not required
by the statute.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></p>

<p>The codification of postal laws presented to Congress in
1908, provided for the creation of a Commission of Postal
Appeals, to consist of three members, one of whom must be
a lawyer, appointed by the President. One of its duties
would be to “pass upon the issuance of fraud orders against
persons alleged to be conducting lotteries, gift enterprises, or
schemes to defraud.” Cases would be submitted by the
assistant attorney general upon his being satisfied that the
evidence was legally sufficient to justify the order which the
Commission would issue or refuse after a hearing; provisional
action, however, could be taken, and pending final
determination, the mail matter could be held in the postoffice.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Power of Congress to Establish Postroads</span></span></h2>

<p id="la"><i>Legislative Action.</i>&mdash;Apart from the postoffice, problems
of road construction and internal improvements, by the
necessities of development, almost immediately confronted
the new nation, which scanned the delegated powers in the
Federal Constitution, and not finding any specific authorization
of congressional action, asserted the right upon several
clauses, among them being the one to establish postroads.
By 1793 there were only one hundred and ninety-five postoffices
throughout the country<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> and communication was in
a deplorable condition, what roads there were being little
more than paths and quite impassable for wheeled vehicles.
Yet communication was of the utmost importance, and
especially was this true in respect to the West, it being
thought that commercial and political development, if not
actual retention, was impossible without easier means of
access. Some road construction had been accomplished by
private initiative with state aid, but the problem was not
really attacked, and when in 1792 Congress established a
postroute between Richmond, Va., and Danville, Ky., and
later one between Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Louisville,<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a>
the West became jealous of the facilities accorded the East.
This feeling was encouraged by the Atlantic States being permitted
by Congress to levy tonnage duties in order to effect
the improvement of rivers and harbors.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> Appropriations
had also been made by Congress for lighthouses, etc., and
soon the demands of the Western States were too strong to
be resisted. In 1806 Congress was forced to take definite
action.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
The constitutional problem, however, had for some time
engaged the attention of the leading statesmen; all admitted
the necessity for federal aid, but the power of Congress
was seriously questioned. In his first annual address
Washington urged the encouragement of “intercourse between
the distant parts of our country by a due attention to
the postoffice and postroads,”<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> and repeated this recommendation
in later addresses.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> Chief Justice Jay had in
1790 given Washington his opinion, certainly entitled to
great weight, that “the Congress have power to establish
postroads. This would be nugatory unless it implied a
power to repair these roads themselves, or compel others to
do it. The former seems to be the more natural construction.
Possibly the turnpike plan might gradually and usefully
be introduced.”<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></p>

<p>But there were also many who held to a stricter construction
of the Constitution. Jefferson was doubtful.
Writing to Madison in 1796 he asked: “Does the power to
<i>establish</i> postroads given you by Congress, mean that you
shall <i>make</i> the roads, or only <i>select</i> from those already
made those on which there shall be a post?” The one construction
would give Congress enormous powers; the other,
if inadequate, could be referred to the states for action.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></p>

<p>The question of federal power was first definitely raised
in 1806 when the demands of the Western States became
irresistible and Congress began the construction of the
Cumberland Road, the famous highway which was to figure
in the economic and political history of the United States
for the next half century, and to arouse acute discussion as
to the meaning of the postal clause.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> Ohio was admitted as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
a state in 1802 and the opportunity was seized to make a
mutually advantageous arrangement by which the United
States would retain the same rights as to the public domain
which it possessed while Ohio was yet a territory (control of
lands as yet unpaid-for and suspension of state taxes), and
on the other hand, as a <i>quid pro quo</i>, a percentage of the
proceeds derived from the sale of certain of the lands,
should be applied to defray the cost of road construction
under the auspices of the general government. Such an
arrangement was first proposed by Gallatin<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> who urged
“that one tenth part of the net proceeds of the lands hereafter
sold by Congress shall, after deducting all expenses
incident to the same, be applied towards laying out and
making turnpike roads ... under the authority of Congress,
with the consent of the several states through which
the same shall pass.”<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></p>

<p>The next action came three years later when Congress
authorized the President to appoint a commission to lay out
the road;<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> consent to the construction had already been
given by the legislatures of Maryland and Virginia, but not
by that of Pennsylvania.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> Maryland’s authorization for
the improvement of postroads within the state was given in
1803 and contained a limitation to the effect that Congress
was not thereby given the power “to cut down or use the
timber or other material of any person or persons against
his, her, or their consent,”<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a>&mdash;an explicit denial of the right
of eminent domain in connection with the postal power.</p>

<p>In January, 1807, Jefferson received the report of the
commission appointed to locate the road, but the President
withheld either acceptance or disapproval until he should receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
“<i>full consent</i> to a free choice of route through the
whole distance.”<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> When Pennsylvania acted, its legislature
detailed the powers which the United States might exercise,
and stipulated that persons whose property should be taken
must be given compensation; but this was sufficient for the
“full consent” which Jefferson demanded before the undertaking
could be begun.</p>

<p>Even with these limitations congressional action as to
postroads had not been taken without some doubts as to its
constitutionality; yet the demands for federal aid were so
great and the responses so meagre that serious objection was
not made. In spite of the fact that he had sanctioned appropriations
for the improvement of a canal in Louisiana
and a road from the Georgia frontier to New Orleans,<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a>
Jefferson thought that the postal clause did not grant adequate
power for the construction of roads by Congress.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a>
In his sixth annual message (after the passage of the Cumberland
Road bill) he urged that the treasury’s surplus
should be applied “to the great purposes of the public education,
roads, canals, and such other objects of public improvement
as it may be thought proper to add to the constitutional
enumeration of federal powers,” but supposed that a constitutional
amendment would be necessary.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> Two years
later the growing surplus led him to return to the same
theme. “Shall the revenue be reduced?” he asked. “Or
shall it rather be appropriated to the improvement of roads,
canals, rivers, education, and other great foundations of
prosperity and union, under the powers which Congress may
already possess, or such amendment of the Constitution
as may be approved by the states. While uncertain of the
course of things the time may be advantageously employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
in obtaining the powers necessary for a system of improvement
should that be thought best.”<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></p>

<p>It was not, however, until during Madison’s administration
that the question was to become an acute one. Under
Washington and Adams there had been no appropriations
for roads; under Jefferson Congress had given money for
the Cumberland Road, for a route from the frontier of
Georgia to New Orleans and a canal in Louisiana.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> But
under Madison eleven acts were passed by Congress<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> and
these caused an exhaustive and sometimes acrimonious discussion
of the constitutional principles involved, with the
intervention of the President through admonitory messages
and one veto, on the day before he was to give up his office.</p>

<p>Madison’s opinion as to whether the Constitution had
given Congress the power to undertake the construction of
roads seems not to have been absolutely consistent. Writing
in <i>The Federalist</i>, he had urged as one of the advantages
that the adoption of the Constitution would insure the fact
that “intercourse throughout the union will be facilitated
by new improvements. Roads will everywhere be shortened,
and kept in better order; accommodations for travellers
will be multiplied and meliorated;... The communication
between the western and Atlantic districts, and between different
parts of each, will be rendered more and more easy by
those numerous canals with which the beneficence of nature
has intersected our country, and which art finds it so little
difficult to connect and complete.”<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></p>

<p>On February 5, 1796, in the House, Madison offered a
resolution authorizing the President to have made a survey
of the postroad from Maine to Georgia, the expense being
borne by the United States.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> Two good effects, said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
Madison, would accrue; “the shortest route from one place
to another would be determined upon, and persons, having
a certainty of the stability of the roads, would not hesitate
to make improvements on them.” It was to be the “commencement
of an extensive work”; and during his administration
Madison approved acts which appropriated over
$500,000, most of it for the Cumberland Road.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></p>

<p>There had been, it is true, an intimation of a changed
attitude when, in his seventh annual message (December 5,
1815), although strongly recommending the construction of
roads and canals under national authority, he called it “a
happy reflection that any defect of constitutional authority
which may be encountered can be supplied in a mode which
the Constitution itself has providently pointed out.”<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> A
year later he asked Congress to exercise its existing powers,
and, if necessary, to resort “to the prescribed mode of enlarging
them, in order to effectuate a comprehensive system
of roads and canals, such as will have the effect of drawing
more closely together every part of our country.”<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></p>

<p>Madison’s decisive stand, however, was to be taken on the
so-called “bonus bill,” the purpose of which was to provide
a permanent fund for road construction. In the famous
report which Gallatin had prepared for the Senate (April
6, 1808), he had denied any right of eminent domain inhering
in the United States and had declared that no road or
canal could be opened without the consent of the states concerned.
This fact, Gallatin argued, necessarily controlled
the manner of expenditure (in the absence of constitutional
amendment). He suggested two expedients: congressional
undertakings with the consent of the states, or subscriptions
by Congress to the shares of companies incorporated for
the purpose of building highways.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> Concerning Gallatin’s
second alternative, no action was taken for two years. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
1810, however, a Senate committee reported favorably a
blanket bill which would make the government owner of
one half the stock in any corporation formed to carry out
the projects recommended by Gallatin in his report.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> But
the theory of the “bonus bill” was radically different.</p>

<p>It was reported in the House by a special committee of
which Calhoun was chairman, and set aside the $1,500,000
bonus which was to be paid by the United States Bank for
its charter, together with the dividend arising from the stock
held by the government; there would thus be provided a
permanent fund for the construction of roads and canals.</p>

<p>The chief argument in support of the bill was made by
Calhoun.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> He expressed no opinion as to the validity of
the objection that Congress had not the power to cut a road
through a state without its consent. The proposed bill did
not raise that question. But, said Calhoun, “the Constitution
gives to Congress the power to establish postoffices and
postroads. I know that the interpretation usually given to
these words confines our powers to that of designating only
the postroads; but it seems to me that the word ‘establish’
comprehends something more,” it would seem to give Congress
the right to construct. Calhoun’s argument is not a
closely reasoned one and does not carry conviction in all
respects; nevertheless, his main point upon which he lays
chief weight,&mdash;that the appropriation of money by Congress
is not confined to the furtherance of those powers enumerated
in the Constitution,&mdash;was well taken.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></p>

<p>The bill was passed by Congress,<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> not, however, without
many doubts being expressed as to its constitutionality,<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a>
and went to President Madison at the very close of his administration.
Madison did not resort to a pocket veto and
on March 3, 1817, sent a message to Congress giving the
grounds for his objections to the measure. He held that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
the act could not be justified under the commerce or general
welfare clauses, but made no use of the postal power as a
possible, if not adequate source of authority. He said:</p>

<p>“If a general power to construct roads and canals, and to
improve the navigation of water courses, with the train of
powers incident thereto, be not possessed by Congress, the
assent of the states in the mode provided in the bill cannot
confer the power. The only cases in which the consent and
cession of particular states can extend the power of Congress
are those specified and provided for in the Constitution.”<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></p>

<p>In this message Madison did not clearly suggest a distinction
between the simple power to appropriate, to appropriate
and construct, with the consent of the states, and to construct
against the will of local jurisdictions. Before reaching
the conclusion quoted above, he had used this ambiguous
language: “A restriction of the power ‘to provide for
the common defense and general welfare’ to cases which
are to be provided for by the expenditure of money would
still leave within the legislative power of Congress all the
great and important measures of government, money being
the ordinary and necessary means of carrying them into
execution.”<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> Madison declared later that his veto contemplated
the appropriation as well as construction; yet
during his tenure he sanctioned measures providing funds
for various roads.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
This distinction which Calhoun pointed out, and concerning
which, in his message at least, Madison was vague, was
to be stressed by Monroe and by Congress in the exhaustive
debates upon the nature and extent of the power that the
federal government possessed.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> Monroe did not delay in
making known his attitude and went directly to the point
in his first annual message when he said:</p>

<p>“Disregarding early impressions, I have bestowed on the
subject all the deliberation which its great importance and a
just sense of my duty required, and the result is, a settled
conviction, in my mind, that Congress do not possess the
right.... In communicating this result, I cannot resist the
obligation which I feel, to suggest to Congress the propriety
of recommending to the states the adoption of an amendment
to the Constitution, which shall give Congress the right
in question.”<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></p>

<p>This portion of President Monroe’s message was referred
to a special committee in the House of Representatives
which reported on December 15, 1817, in an able document.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a>
The problem, said the committee, involved “a
great constitutional question on the one hand,” and was
“intimately connected on the other, with the improvement,
the prosperity, the union, and the happiness of the United
States.” It was argued, in brief, that Congress had the
power: “1. To lay out, improve, and construct postroads
through the several states, with the assent of the respective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
states. 2. To open, construct, and improve military roads
through the several states, with the assent of the respective
states. 3. To cut canals through the several states, with
their assent....”</p>

<p>Such powers were not based, it was contended, on a liberal
construction of the Constitution, nor were they dangerous
in tendency and capable of working an injury to the states,
for there was no recognition of a right of eminent domain
or of congressional supremacy in respect to jurisdiction.
Considering specifically the extent of the postal power the
committee said:</p>

<p>“That Congress, with the assent of the states respectively,
may construct and improve their postroads, under the power
‘to establish postoffices and postroads’ seems to be manifest
both from the nature of things and from analogous constructions
of the Constitution. It has been contended, indeed,
that the word <i>establish</i>, in this clause of the instrument,
comprehends nothing more than a mere designation
of postroads. But if this be true, the important powers
conferred on the general government in relation to the postoffice,
might be rendered in a great measure inefficient and
impracticable.... If the power to establish confers only
the authority to designate, Congress can have no right either
to keep a ferry over a deep and rapid river for the transportation
of the mails, or to compel the owners of a ferry
to perform that service; and yet our laws contain an act,
acquiesced in for more than twenty years, imposing penalties
on ferrymen for detaining the mail and on other persons
for retarding or obstructing its passage. It would be difficult
to discover how this power of imposing penalties can
be supported, either as an original or accessory power except
upon principles of more liberal construction than those now
advanced....</p>

<p>“The authority which is conferred by the Constitution to
make all laws which shall be ‘necessary and proper’ for
carrying into execution the enumerated powers, is believed
to vest in the general government all the means which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
essential to the complete enjoyment of the privilege of
‘establishing postoffices and postroads!’ Even without this
clause of the Constitution the same principle would have to
be applied to its construction, since according to common
understanding the grant of a power implies a grant of whatever
is necessary to its enjoyment....</p>

<p>“It is indeed from the operation of these words ‘necessary
and proper’ in the clause of the Constitution which grants
accessory powers, that the ‘assent of the respective states’
is conceived a prerequisite to the improvement even of postroads.
For, however ‘necessary’ such improvements might
be, it might be questioned how far an interference with the
state jurisdiction over its soil, against its will, might be
‘proper,’ Nor is this instance of an imperfect right in the
general government without an analogy in the Constitution;
the power of exercising jurisdiction over forts, magazines,
arsenals, and dockyards, depending upon previous purchase
by the United States with the consent of the states.</p>

<p>“Admitting then, that the Constitution confers only a
right of way, and that the rights of soil and jurisdiction
remain exclusively with the states respectively, yet there
seems to be no sound objection to the improvement of roads
with their assent.”</p>

<p>In the long debate which followed this report upon the
President’s message, the opinions expressed veered between
ultra-conservative and ultra-liberal positions. A middle
ground was taken by Clay, whose speeches are perhaps the
best on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> He was a stanch supporter of the
committee’s report, contending “that the power to construct
postroads is expressly granted in the power to establish
postroads.” “If it be,” he said, “there is an end to the
controversy.... To show that the power is expressly
granted, I might safely appeal to the arguments already used
to prove that the word <i>establish</i>, in this case, can mean only
one thing,&mdash;the right of making.” According to Clay, “to
establish justice” as used in the preamble of the Constitution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
did not compel Congress to adopt the systems then
existing. “Establishment means in the preamble, as in
other cases, construction, formation, creation.”</p>

<p>When it is considered that “under the old Articles of
Confederation, Congress had over the subject of postroads
as much power as gentlemen allow to the existing government,
that it was the general scope and spirit of the new
Constitution to enlarge the powers of the general government,
and that, in fact, in this very clause, the power to
establish postroads is superadded to the power to establish
postoffices, which was alone possessed by the former government,”
the argument on this point is successfully maintained.</p>

<p>Clay contended that “it was certainly no objection to the
power that these roads might also be used for other purposes.
It was rather a recommendation that other objects,
beneficial to the people, might be thus obtained, though not
within the words of the Constitution.” For an illustration
he pointed to the encouragement of manufactures under the
power to levy taxes. Postroads could be devoted to “other
purposes connected with the good of society.”<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> Construction
completed, Clay argued, Congress had a jurisdiction
“concurrent with the states, over the road, for the purpose
of preserving it, but for no other purpose. In regard to all
matters occurring on the road, whether of crime, or contract,
etc., or any object of jurisdiction unconnected with the
preservation of the road, there remained to the states exclusive
jurisdiction.”<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></p>

<p>At the conclusion of the debate several resolutions were
offered and voted upon, only one receiving a majority. It
recited “that Congress have power, under the Constitution,
to appropriate money for the construction of postroads,
military and other roads, and of canals and for the improvement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
of water courses.” In this matter Congress sanctioned
the distinction between appropriation and construction.
Three other resolutions were to the effect that Congress
could build, generally, post and military roads; roads
and canals necessary “for commerce between the states,”
and canals for “military purposes.” These avowals of
power, although they stated slightly different propositions,
all intimated that the consent of the states would not be
required, since each contained a proviso that private property
should not be taken for public use without compensation,&mdash;a
liberal attitude for this period of constitutional interpretation.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a>
All of the resolutions, save the first, failed of
passage by small majorities.</p>

<p>The consideration of Monroe’s message in the Senate was
very favorable to the President; there was little disposition
to criticize him for having announced his views prematurely,&mdash;possibly
with the intention of warning Congress,&mdash;and no
attempt was made to ascertain directly the Senate’s opinion
on the constitutional powers of Congress. Indirectly, however,
the Senate asserted its opinion through passing on a
proposed amendment to the Constitution which was urged
in response to Monroe’s intimation that this was the proper
method of dealing with the matter.</p>

<p>From time to time several proposed amendments to the
Constitution had been introduced, and these, unlike others
advocated during “the same period of conflict between
the broad and strict constructionists,”<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> aimed to increase the
powers of Congress, and to take away the taint of usurpation
which, at least in the minds of many, was considered as
attaching to the road projects either under way or seriously
contemplated. Amendments empowering Congress to construct
roads and canals with the consent of the states were
suggested in 1813 and 1814, and on December 9, 1817, following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
the advice of Monroe’s message, Senator Barbour
introduced in the Senate such a resolution which made state
consent necessary and provided that the appropriations
should be distributed “in the ratio of representation which
each state shall have in the most numerous branch of the
national legislature. But the portion of any state may be
applied to the purpose aforesaid in any other state.” When
the resolution was reported, it was indefinitely postponed by
a vote of 22 to 9.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> This result showed that there was
slight chance of passing any general road construction bill
over the president’s veto, although some of the votes against
the resolution were cast on the ground that Congress already
had the power.</p>

<p>But the advocates of road construction were not to be
denied. In compliance with a resolution, Calhoun, as secretary
of war, submitted to the House of Representatives on
January 14, 1819, a comprehensive report on roads and
canals, the necessity for them, and a scheme for construction.
Calhoun, however, “thought it improper under the resolution
of the House to discuss the constitutional question.”<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></p>

<p>The report was laid on the table<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> and although in January,
1822, the House Committee favored surveys for canals
from Boston south along the Atlantic coast, and in the
middle west, and a road from Washington to New Orleans,
nothing became law with the exception of small appropriations
for the Cumberland Road.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> It was, however, an act
for the preservation and repair of this road, passed by the
House on April 29, 1822, and returned by the President on
May 4, which caused him to follow his veto message with
a comprehensive statement of the “Views of the President
of the United States on the subject of internal improvements,”<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
the most elaborate constitutional discussion ever
sent to the Capitol from the White House.</p>

<p>Monroe was of the opinion that Congress had the right
to make appropriations for roads, with the consent of the
states through which they were to pass, but that it did not
have sovereign and jurisdictional rights to construct roads
or to repair and keep them free from obstructions. This
doctrine Von Holst calls a “quibble on words,” but “it has
become an established one that Congress may appropriate
money in aid of matters which the federal government is not
constitutionally able to administer and regulate,” and in this
respect, therefore, Monroe was correct.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></p>

<p>The advocates of construction and of efficient jurisdiction
after the roads had been made, derived the authority of
Congress from several clauses in the Constitution, among
them the grant “to establish postoffices and postroads.” To
this clause, Monroe gave an exhaustive treatment.</p>

<p>“What is the just import of these words, and the extent
of the grant?” he asked. “The word ‘establish’ is the
ruling term; ‘postoffices and postroads’ are the subjects, on
which it acts. The question, therefore, is, what power is
granted by that word? The sense, in which our words are
commonly used, is that, in which they are to be understood
in all transactions between public bodies and individuals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
The intention of the parties is to prevail, and there is no
better way of ascertaining it, than by giving to the terms
used their ordinary import.”</p>

<p>Among enlightened citizens, Monroe went on, there would
be no difference of opinion; “all of them would answer,
that a power was thereby given to Congress to fix on the
towns, court-houses, and other places, throughout our
Union, at which there should be postoffices; the routes by
which the mails should be carried from one postoffice to
another, so as to diffuse intelligence as extensively, and to
make the institution as useful, as possible; to fix the postage
to be paid on every letter and packet thus carried to support
the establishment; and to protect the postoffices and mails
from robbery, by punishing those, who should commit the
offence. The idea of a right to lay off the roads of the
United States, on a general scale of improvement; to take
the soil from the proprietor by force; to establish turnpikes
and tolls, and to punish offenders in the manner stated
above, would never occur to any such person. The use of
the existing road, by the stage, mail carrier, or postboy, in
passing over it, as others do, is all that would be thought of;
the jurisdiction and soil remaining to the state, with a right
in the state, or those authorized by its legislature, to change
the road at pleasure.”</p>

<p>This interpretation, the message went on to declare, was
supported by the modification of the postal grant in the
Articles of Confederation, as it appeared in the Constitution.
“Had it been intended to convey a more enlarged power in
the Constitution,” said Monroe, “than had been granted in
the Confederation, surely the same controlling term [establish]
would not have been used; or other words would have
been added, to show such intention, and to mark the extent,
to which the power should be carried.... It would be
absurd to say, that, by omitting from the Constitution any
portion of the phraseology, which was deemed important in
the Confederation, the import of that term was enlarged,
and with it the powers of the Constitution, in a proportional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
degree, beyond what they were in the Confederation. The
right to exact postage and to protect the postoffices and
mails from robbery, by punishing the offenders, may fairly
be considered, as incidents to the grant, since, without it, the
object of the grant might be defeated. Whatever is absolutely
necessary to the accomplishment of the object of the
grant, though not specified, may fairly be considered as included
in it. Beyond this the doctrine of incidental power
cannot be carried.” Monroe then enters upon a consideration
of what the colonists and framers of the Constitution
understood to be comprehended in the postal power, and
concludes:</p>

<p>“If the United States possessed the power contended for
under this grant, might they not, in adopting the roads of
the individual states for the carriage of the mail, as has been
done, assume jurisdiction over them, and preclude a right to
interfere with or alter them? Might they not establish
turnpikes, and exercise all the other acts of sovereignty,
above stated, over such roads, necessary to protect them
from injury, and defray the expense of repairing them?
Surely, if the right exists, these consequences necessarily
followed, as soon as the road was established. The absurdity
of such a pretension must be apparent to all, who
examine it. In this way, a large portion of the territory of
every state might be taken from it; for there is scarcely a
road in any state, which will not be used for the transportation
of the mail. A new field for legislation and internal
government would thus be opened.”<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
While the President’s attitude stopped Congress from
actually constructing roads, frequent appropriations were
granted to be applied under the direction of the states.
Perhaps the most important of these was in the act passed
in 1824 to have surveys made of such roads and canals as
in the opinion of the President were of value for military,
commercial and postal purposes.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></p>

<p>Conflict over the constitutional problem, and the distinction
between appropriation and construction, were, however,
abandoned by John Quincy Adams who was a stanch advocate
of federal aid,<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> but the discussion was revived by
Jackson, who vetoed six bills,<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> the most important of which
provided for a government subscription of $150,000 to purchase
stock in the Maysville, Washington, Paris and Lexington
Turnpike Company, a Kentucky corporation. The action
of the President did not come as a surprise for in his
first annual message he had told Congress that the mode of
internal improvements, “hitherto adopted, has by many of
our fellow citizens been deprecated as an infraction of the
constitution, while by others it has been viewed as inexpedient.
All feel that it has been employed at the expense
of harmony in the legislative councils.”<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, Jackson thoroughly disapproved of the government’s
becoming a minority stockholder in a semi-private
enterprise which would receive profits through the payment
of tolls. He held it to be not only “highly expedient, but
indispensably necessary, that a previous amendment of the
Constitution, delegating the necessary power and defining
and restricting its exercise with reference to the sovereignty
of the states, should be made.”<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> Otherwise there would be
a continuance of congressional uncertainty as to the existence
of the power. He considered the general question in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
two aspects: (1) as “to the power of making internal improvements
within the limits of a state, with the right of
territorial jurisdiction, sufficient at least for their preservation
and use” and (2) as to the power of “appropriating
money in aid of such works when carried on by a state or
by a company in virtue of state authority, surrendering the
claim of jurisdiction.”<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> He believed Congress could appropriate
directly for <i>national</i>, not <i>local</i>, purposes; the other
power he firmly denied.</p>

<p>After Jackson there were other vetoes of internal improvement
bills, but they were based largely upon the distinction
between national and local objects. Road construction,
moreover, gave way to river and harbor development,
and there was little, if any, discussion of the meaning
of the postal clause. Congress asserted a broad power over
postroads designated by it, and there was little objection;
on the few occasions that the matter came before the courts,
the power was sustained. In 1862 Congress gave the President
authority when in his judgment the public safety required
its exercise, to take possession of all railroads and
telegraphs and to place their employees under military control,
so that the lines would be “considered as a postroad
and a part of the military establishment of the United
States, subject to all the rules and restrictions imposed by
the rules and articles of war.”<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> Any interference with
the exercise of this authority was made a crime. Compensation
to the railroad and telegraph companies was to be
fixed by three commissioners, subject to approval by Congress.
This authorization, however, was based upon the
war, as well as on the postal power, and when Congress
came to charter railroads and bridge companies, it based its
right largely on the commerce clause, with the postal and
war grants as ancillary sources.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></p>

<p>Recent evidences of congressional action, based upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
postroads clause, are to be seen in the good roads movement,
and in 1912 Congress appropriated five hundred thousand
dollars for “improving the condition of roads to be
selected by them [the secretary of agriculture and the postmaster
general] over which rural delivery is or may hereafter
be established, such improvement to be for the purpose
of ascertaining the increase in the territory which could be
served by each carrier as a result of such improvement, the
possible increase of the number of delivery days in each
year,” etc. But it is provided that the state in which the
improvements are to be made “shall furnish double the
amount of money for the improvement of the road or roads
so selected.”<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> The results of the scheme have not been
very satisfactory,<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> but proposals are made for other, and
more extensive federal undertakings. Finally it is possible,
in some measure at least, to base upon the postal power the
Act of March 12, 1914, which authorizes “the president of
the United States to locate, construct and operate railroads
in the Territory of Alaska.”<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></p>

<p id="jd"><i>Judicial Determinations.</i>&mdash;The power of Congress to construct
roads and canals did not, in the early days of its
assertion and denial, come before the Supreme Court of the
United States; in fact, the question has never been directly
passed upon by the Court, and long before it was incidentally
considered, largely in the cases upholding the right of eminent
domain and its delegation to railroad corporations with
federal charters, the constitutional problem, as Madison said
in rejecting the bank bill of 1814, was “precluded by repeated
recognitions, under varied circumstances, of the
validity of the exercise of a power to establish a bank by
Congress, in acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial
branches of the government, accompanied by indications in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
different modes of a concurrence of the general will of the
nation.”<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> Such a test, however, is by no means adequate.</p>

<p>For a time the question of congressional power was acute,
and its existence was not acknowledged, even by some who
cannot be called strict constructionists. The opinions held
by Congress and the executive have already been reviewed;
but Monroe’s elaborate veto message on the “gate bill” gave
the Supreme Court justices an opportunity to express their
views informally, for he sent a copy of his paper to each
member of the Court. In his reply Justice Johnson intimated
that the doctrine of McCulloch v. Maryland<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> committed
the Court to upholding a power in Congress to construct
roads for military and postal purposes; Marshall considered
the question one “on which many divide in opinion,
but all will admit that your views are profound and that
you have thought much on the subject.” Story was noncommittal,
and thus one of the few attempts to get an informal
expression of opinion from the Supreme Court was
a failure.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></p>

<p>It is difficult to see how, logically, there can be any doubt
as to a very wide authority in Congress. A fair interpretation
of the word “establish” comprehends “construction”
or at least something more than “designation”; otherwise
it would have been futile for the Articles of Confederation
and the Constitution to give Congress powers under which
it has undertaken to “establish” navy hospitals, trading
houses with the Indians, inferior courts, rules of capture,
and regulations of trade. The second portion of the postal
clause did not appear in the Articles of Confederation, and
the grant in the Constitution was absolute, with no limitations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
as to state action. A restricted interpretation, applied
to the first part of the clause, as demanded by consistency,
would give Congress authority to provide postoffices, but
without mails, carriers, routes, secure transmission, or
revenue. That Congress in fact had the power to construct
roads has been made evident, I think, by the debates on the
various measures that were proposed.</p>

<p>But as has been seen in the legislation concerning the
Cumberland Road, the consent of the states was required
before construction could be started, and limitations were
imposed on the federal power. So also, it was at first maintained
that Congress did not have the right to keep the roads
open, in repair, and to impose tolls for their use, whether
they had been constructed under national authority or had
simply been designated as mail routes. For example, the
Act of March 26, 1804, provided “that whenever it shall
be made to appear to the satisfaction of the postmaster
general that any road established by this or any former act,
as a postroad, is obstructed by fences, gates or bars, other
than those lawfully used on turnpike roads, to collect their
toll, and not kept in good repair with proper bridges and
ferries, where the same may be necessary it shall be the
duty of the postmaster general to report the same to Congress,
with such information as can be obtained, to enable
Congress to establish some other road, instead of it, in the
same main direction.”<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a></p>

<p>In 1812 Gallatin made a report to the President on the
Cumberland Road and referred to the necessity of levying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
tolls sufficient to keep certain portions in repair; but this, he
said, could be done “only under the authority of the state
of Maryland.”<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> The next year the superintendent of the
road reported to Gallatin that he expected the Maryland
legislature to pass a law, “authorizing the President to
receive toll, for the purpose of repairing the road, and likewise
against abuses which are common on all roads of the
kind to prevent which laws have been found necessary.”<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a>
Secretary Dallas was of the same opinion, and in 1815 told
the House Committee on the Cumberland Road that Congress
had no authority to make provision for tolls and the
prevention of abuses. “They can only proceed,” he said,
“from the legislatures of the states through which the road
passes, and consist of an authority for the erection of toll
gates, and the collection of a toll sufficient to defray the
expenses of repair, and the infliction of penalties upon
persons who shall cut, break up, or otherwise destroy or
injure the road.”<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a></p>

<p>The House Committee, however, held that since a compact
had been entered into between the federal government
and the states, Congress had the right to legislate in order
to carry out its undertaking to open and maintain the road.
“If the right to punish these offences belongs to the national
government,” said the committee, “it may be effected without
the passage of any law, by an indictment or information
in the courts of the United States, or by enacting statutory
provisions fixing the penalties, it being a fundamental right
of the judiciary inherent in every government to punish all
offences against the laws passed in pursuance of a delegated
power independently of express legislative sanctions.”<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></p>

<p>After President Monroe’s veto, the Cumberland Road became
sadly in need of repairs, and again Congress considered
the question of jurisdiction,&mdash;whether the right to <i>preserve</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
was incidental to the right to <i>establish</i>. The states passed
laws to protect the road against injuries and appropriated
money for improvements, but the sums provided were inadequate<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a>
and soon a disposition was shown to consent to
the assumption by Congress of complete control over the
Road. The Pennsylvania legislature passed a resolution
(1828) giving the federal government permission to collect
tolls within the commonwealth, with the reservation that the
whole amount collected should be devoted to repairs.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></p>

<p>Monroe had desired cooperation between the national and
local authorities. In his message of December 2, 1823, he
urged “an arrangement with the several states through
which the Road passes, to establish tolls, each within its
limits, for the purpose of defraying the expense of future
repairs and providing also by suitable penalties for its protection
against future injuries.”<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> This portion of the
message was considered by the House Committee on Roads
and Canals, whose opinion it was that Congress had itself
the right to charge tolls and punish offences; the committee
could not approve of an arrangement by which the states
might charge tolls: uniformity and one jurisdiction were
eminently desirable.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> Yet in 1828&ndash;1829 when the whole
question of control was again threshed out in Congress, any
federal right, either absolutely or by virtue of state permission,
to charge tolls, was still denied. Congress simply
appropriated $100,000 for the repair of the road; Monroe’s
distinction between <i>appropriation</i> and <i>control</i> was adhered
to.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></p>

<p>The states, moreover, still asserted plenary authority. In
1833 the Maryland legislature gave the President authority
to make a change in the Cumberland Road<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> and in 1834
Illinois consented to the extension of the national road
“through the territory of said state so as to cross the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Mississippi River at the town of Alton and no other point.”<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a>
For various reasons the road was not constructed, but Congress
was several times memorialized to take the desired
action<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> and in 1844 the Senate Committee on Roads and
Canals, having under consideration a bill to extend the highway
to Alton, made a favorable recommendation and pointed
out the fact that the consent of the states affected was a
necessary preliminary before actual construction could
begin.</p>

<p>“The right of the state of Illinois to give or withhold her
assent to the construction of the road within her limits,”
said the committee’s report, “cannot be questioned in view
of the course pursued by the general government to obtain
the consent of other states.”<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> Reports to identical effect
were made during the second session of the 28th Congress
(January 15, 1845) and the second session of the 29th Congress
(January 16, 1847),<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> the second report being accompanied
by a strong letter from Senator Semple of Illinois,
who pointed out that his state would never consent to any
route other than the one which had been recommended in
1834.</p>

<p>Meanwhile definitive action had been taken during Jackson’s
administration, as a result of his determined opposition
to internal improvements and denial of federal authority
to construct roads. “Annual appropriations for the repair
of the road were being made, but this method could not continue
indefinitely, inasmuch as tolls could not be levied by
the United States for repairs. Because of the lack of
jurisdiction, a resort to state control, with the consent of
Congress became an absolute necessity.”<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> Acts of the
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio and Virginia legislatures
were, therefore, passed, and congressional assent was given
to the erection of toll gates and repairs by the states, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
provision in the compact that no charge should be made for
the passage of United States mails, troops or property. In
1879 the control of the states was made complete and
unreserved. Yet the original acts of surrender recognized
“either a proprietary or jurisdictional interest, or both, in
the United States, as follows: (1) something was surrendered;
(2) surrender was made by ‘compacts’ which
regulated the number of toll gates and the rates of toll; (3)
provision was made for the United States to resume its proprietary
or jurisdictional interest at pleasure.”<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></p>

<p>But before the legal questions arising out of this surrender
were passed upon by the Supreme Court of the
United States, the whole problem of congressional power
and the rights of the states was carefully considered by the
Kentucky Court of Appeals, whose opinion,<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> treating points
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">primae impressionis</i>, is remarkably well considered. The
particular question to be decided was whether a contractor
for carrying the mail between points within the state on a
turnpike road had any right of exemption from the tolls,
exacted under the company’s charter from other persons
for the transit of their horses and stages. The court held
that the tolls should be paid.</p>

<p>It recognized that the postal power “being necessarily
exclusive, plenary and supreme, no state can constitutionally
do, or authorize to be done, any act which may frustrate,
counteract, or impair the proper and effectual exercise of it
by national authority. From these axiomatic truths it follows
as a plain corollary that the general government has the
right to transport the national mail <i>whenever</i> and <i>wherever</i>
the national Congress, in the <i>constitutional</i> exercise of its
delegated power over <i>postoffices</i> and <i>postroads</i> shall have
prescribed.” But, said the court, this power was not unlimited,
and could not appropriate private property for public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
use without just compensation. If the turnpike was considered
as private property in view of the company’s franchise,
tolls should be paid by the mail contractor; considering
the turnpike as a public state road, the court reached the
same conclusion, which, it pointed out, would not have been
modified had Congress seen fit to designate this particular
road as a mail route. Anyone doubting the logic of this, the
court said, “should also doubt whether his own house might
not be taken and used as a postoffice without his consent
and without any compensation.”</p>

<p>The court then proceeded, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">obiter</i>, to explain its understanding
of the postroads power. According to reason and
philology, the import of “establish” was declared to be, not
merely “designate” but “found, prepare, make, institute
and confirm.” “So too,” the court held, “as roads and
good roads are indispensable to the effectual establishment
of postroads, the supreme power to ‘establish postroads’
necessarily includes the power to make, repair and preserve
such roads as may be suitable....” Congress therefore
was considered to have the power to open roads and build
bridges when necessary; there was no question of constitutional
right, simply of expediency.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></p>

<p>“Unless Congress shall elect to exercise its right of eminent
domain, and buy a state road, or make one, or help to
make or repair it, the constitution gives no authority to use
it as a postroad without the consent of the state or the
owner, without making just compensation for the use.”
Here was acknowledgment of an authority more far reaching
than even the more liberal contemporary opinion gave to
Congress; the court recognized a right of eminent domain
to take over a road, but until this was exercised, the mails
were subject to tolls.</p>

<p>When, seven years later, the Supreme Court of the United
States passed upon the toll question which arose under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
compact ceding the Cumberland Road to the states,<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> there
was the same opportunity to make a definite pronouncement
as to the authority of Congress to engage in road
construction; in its opinion, however, the Court made no
use of this opportunity, although a dissentient justice voiced
his views that the power of Congress was not so great as
that asserted in the Dickey case.</p>

<p>The act of the Ohio legislature in taking over the Cumberland
Road specifically provided that tolls should not be
collected for the passage of the mails; but the Pennsylvania
law was more general, declaring that “no toll shall be received
or collected for the passage of any wagon or carriage
laden with the property of the United States....” The
Maryland act was precisely the same as this, while the Virginia
statute followed the Ohio law. In 1836, however,
Pennsylvania declared that the exemption should be only
in proportion to the amount of property belonging to the
United States, and “that in all cases of wagons, carriages,
stages or other modes of conveyance, carrying the United
States mail, with passengers or goods, such wagon, stage,
or other mode of conveyance shall pay half-toll upon such
modes of conveyance.”</p>

<p>The validity of this legislation was the question presented
to the Supreme Court, and in its decision the Court could
well have entered upon a discussion of the power of Congress
in the premises. But Chief Justice Taney, who delivered
the opinion, was at pains to point out, “that the constitutional
power of the general government to construct this
road is not involved in the case before us; nor is the court
called upon to express any opinion on that subject; nor to
inquire what were the rights of the United States in the
road previous to the compacts hereinbefore mentioned.”</p>

<p>Taney simply held, therefore, that “the United States
have unquestionably a property in the mails”; that this
property was exempted from the payment of tolls by the
terms of the compact, but this exemption should not apply to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
other property in the same vehicle, nor to any person unless
in the service of the United States. Finally, in answer to
the objection that small parcels might be sent by a number
of conveyances to relieve them from the payment of
tolls, Taney held that “the United States cannot claim an
exemption for more carriages than are necessary for the
safe, speedy, and convenient conveyance of the mail.”</p>

<p>From Taney’s judgment, Justice McLean dissented, primarily
on the ground that “the mail of the United States
is not the property of the United States,” and that charging
tolls for its passage was not in violation of the compact.
Justice Daniels, however, objected upon different grounds,
and declared that it was necessary to consider “the operation
and effect of the compact insisted upon as controlled
and limited by the powers of both contracting parties.”</p>

<p>“I hold then,” he declared, “that neither Congress nor the
federal government in the exercise of all or any of its
powers or attributes possesses the power to construct roads,
nor any other description of what have been called internal
improvements within the limits of the states. That the
territory and soil of the several states appertain to them by
title paramount to the Constitution, and cannot be taken,
save with the exception of those portions which might be
ceded for the seat of the federal government and for sites
permitted to be purchased for forts, arsenals, dockyards,
etc. That the power of the federal government to acquire,
and that of the states to cede, to that government portions of
their territory, are by the Constitution limited to the instances
above adverted to, and that these powers can neither
be enlarged, nor modified, but in virtue of some new faculty
to be imparted by amendments of the Constitution.</p>

<p>“I believe that the authority vested in Congress by the
Constitution to establish postroads, confers no right to open
new roads, but implies nothing beyond a discretion in the
government in the regulations it may make for the postoffice
department for the selection amongst the various
routes, whilst they continue in existence, of those along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
which it may be deemed most judicious to have the mails
transported. I do not believe that this power given to
Congress expresses or implies anything peculiar in relation
to the means or modes of transporting the public mail, or
refers to any supposed means or modes of transportation
beyond the usual manner existing and practised in the
country, and certainly it cannot be understood to destroy or
in anywise to affect the proprietary rights belonging to individuals
or companies vested in those roads. It guarantees
to the government the right to avail itself of the facilities
offered by those roads for the purposes of transportation,
but imparts to it no exclusive rights&mdash;it puts the government
upon the footing of others who would avail themselves
of the same facilities.”</p>

<p>For these reasons, “the government could legally claim
no power to collect tolls, no exemption from tolls, nor any
diminution of tolls in their favor, purely in consequence of
their having expended money on the road, and without the
recognition by Pennsylvania of that expenditure as a condition
in any contract they might make with that state.”
Nevertheless the United States could contract with Pennsylvania,
and so Justice Daniels examined the terms of the
agreement, coming to the conclusion that by its terms, United
States mail was not exempt from toll charges.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></p>

<p>While the authority of the majority opinion in this case
is somewhat lessened by the fact that the argument was as
to the meaning of the compact, it was held, impliedly at
least, that in order to carry out one of its delegated powers,&mdash;the
establishment of postoffices and postroads,&mdash;the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
States might, by compact, enter upon a scheme of internal
improvements. Furthermore, the court, by holding that the
general government had the right to enter into the compact
of surrender, recognized an original federal interest in the
Cumberland Road. The clear import of the majority
opinion is, I think, that if Taney had considered it necessary
to pass upon the point, Congress would have been accorded
the right to construct postroads, and this would have included
authority to charge tolls for the use of the highways
by others than the postoffice department.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></p>

<p>These adjudications were carried a long step further
when the Supreme Court asserted the federal right of eminent
domain which had been foreshadowed in the Dickey
case, but not exercised by Congress.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> In 1864 the Northern
Pacific Railroad was incorporated, and lands were
granted to aid in the construction, but the act provided that
the company “shall obtain the consent of the legislature of
any state through which any portion of said railroad line
may pass, previous to commencing the construction thereof.”
Congress reserved the right to appeal or amend the act,
“to secure to the government at all times (but particularly
in time of war) the use and benefits of the same for postal,
military and other purposes.”<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> In 1868, however, Congress
undertook improvements in the Mississippi River, and
authorized its agents to take possession of the necessary
materials “after having first paid or secured to be paid, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
value thereof which may have been ascertained in the mode
provided by the laws of the state.”<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a></p>

<p>When the question came before the courts there was little
hesitancy in holding that Congress had a right of eminent
domain. The Circuit Court for the Southern District of
Ohio declared that “the constitutional provisions giving to
Congress authority to establish postoffices and postroads,
and to make all laws for carrying into effect the enumerated
powers, taken together with the declaration that all laws
made in pursuance of the Constitution shall be the supreme
law of the land, invest Congress with authority to condemn
lands situated within a state for use as a postoffice site.”<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> A
holding to the same effect was made by the Supreme Court
of the United States which declared:</p>

<p>“It is true, this power of the federal government has not
heretofore been exercised adversely; but the non-user of a
power does not disprove its existence.... If the United
States have the power, it must be complete in itself. It can
neither be enlarged nor diminished by a state. Nor can any
state prescribe the manner in which it must be exercised.
The consent of a state can never be a condition precedent to
its enjoyment.”<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></p>

<p>But before this right of eminent domain was recognized,
a broad legislative control had been assumed over the highways
of the country. In 1838 Congress declared “that each
and every railroad within the limits of the United States
which now is, or hereafter may be made and completed,
shall be a postroute,”<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> and in 1856, the Supreme Court
(under the commerce clause, however) sanctioned a further
extension.</p>

<p>Bridges across the Ohio River at Wheeling were alleged
by the State of Pennsylvania to be an obstruction of navigation
and their removal was ordered by the Supreme Court.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
The decree had not been executed when, by act of Congress
(1852), the bridges were “declared to be lawful structures
in their present positions and elevations, and shall be so held
and taken to be, anything in the law or laws of the United
States to the contrary notwithstanding,” and further, “that
the said bridges be declared to be and are established postroads
for the passage of the mails of the United States.”</p>

<p>Later, the main bridge being blown down, the Supreme
Court granted an injunction restraining the reconstruction.
The company disregarded the order and upon motions by
the plaintiff to attach the defendant’s property for contempt,
and by the company to dissolve the injunction, the Supreme
Court held that the act of Congress vacated the decree and
superseded its effect and operation. The Court said:</p>

<p>“We do not enter upon the question, whether or not Congress
possess the power, under the authority of the Constitution,
‘to establish postoffices and postroads’ to legalize
this bridge; for, concluding that no such powers can be
derived from this clause, it must be admitted that it is, at
least, necessarily included in the powers conferred to regulate
commerce among the several states.”<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a></p>

<p>By the act of March 2, 1861,<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> moreover, the monopoly
provisions of earlier statutes were extended to all postroutes,
already or thereafter established, but letter carrier
routes within cities did not become postroads until so declared
by Congress in 1872, and at the present time, in addition
to railroads and routes for the collection and delivery of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
the mail, the following are established as postroads: all
waters of the United States, canals, and plank roads during
the time the mail is carried thereon; “the road on which the
mail is carried to supply any courthouse which may be without
a mail, and the road on which the mail is carried under
contract made by the postmaster general for extending the
line of posts to supply mails to postoffices not on any established
route, during the time such mail is carried thereon”;
and “all public roads and highways while kept up and
maintained as such.”<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> In order to insure the safe passage
of the mails, the federal government may take all necessary
measures to remove obstructions and prevent depredations,
even on the public streets of a town.</p>

<p>Finally, under three grants in the Constitution,&mdash;to regulate
commerce, to establish postoffices and postroads, and to
raise and support armies,&mdash;Congress has chartered transcontinental
railway companies and bridge companies. It
has, moreover, granted to these corporations the power of
eminent domain to be exercised without the consent or permission
of the states. In holding that the franchises of the
Union Pacific Railroad Company were federal franchises,
properly granted, and beyond the power of the state to tax,
the Supreme Court said:</p>

<p>“It cannot at the present day be doubted that Congress
under the power to regulate commerce among the several
states, as well as to provide for postal accommodations and
military exigencies, had authority to pass these laws. The
power to construct, or to authorize individuals or corporations
to construct, national highways and bridges from state
to state, is essential to the complete control and regulation
of interstate commerce. Without authority in Congress to
establish and maintain such highways and bridges, it would
be without authority to regulate one of the most important
adjuncts of commerce. This power in former times was
exerted to a very limited extent, the Cumberland or National
Road being the most notable instance. Its exertion was but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
little called for, as commerce was then mostly conducted by
water, and many of our statesmen entertained doubts as to
the existence of the power to establish ways of communication
by land. But since, in consequence of the expansion
of the country, the multiplication of its products, the invention
of railroads and locomotion by steam, land transportation
has so vastly increased, a sounder consideration of the
subject has prevailed, and led to the conclusion that Congress
has plenary power over the whole subject. Of course,
the authority of Congress over the territories of the United
States, and its power to grant franchises exercisable therein,
are, and ever have been, undoubted. But the wider power
was very freely exercised, and much to the general satisfaction,
in the creation of the vast system of railroads connecting
the East with the Pacific, traversing states as well as
territories and employing the agency of state as well as
federal corporations.”<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></p>

<p>Early attempts, then, by Congress to furnish postal facilities
and open up communication through the construction of
highways for the carriage of the mails, met with denials that
the power “to establish postroads” meant more than the
power to designate the roads to be used, and that, even if
this were not so, any action could be taken without the consent
of the states whose territory was to be used. To permit
national undertakings, however, Monroe developed the distinction
that Congress might appropriate for roads to be
laid out with the consent of the states, but that the national
government had no jurisdictional rights to construct, repair
or keep the highways free from obstructions. This distinction,
which Von Holst called a “quibble on words,” was
abandoned by John Quincy Adams, who was a stanch advocate
of federal aid, but was revived by Jackson, who believed
that appropriations could be made for <i>national</i>, but
not for <i>local</i> purposes. In Congress, during the whole of
this period, various views were expressed, but the better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
opinion, accepted by the authority, if not by the majority, of
the speakers, was that Congress had powers (occasionally
exercised) which were broader than the executives were disposed
to concede.</p>

<p>The continued assertion by the states of plenary authority
and the failure of Congress to adopt any successful plan by
which the Cumberland Road might be kept in repair, led
to compacts of surrender under which the national authorities
gave up all control over this highway. The meaning of
these compacts was examined by the Supreme Court of the
United States, and the plain implication of the decisions
(although definite expressions were not necessary for the
determination of the particular questions presented) is that
Congress had the right to construct postroads and to charge
tolls for their use by others than postal officials. This power
had already been conceded in an illuminating opinion by the
Kentucky Court of Appeals, and the subsequent decisions
recognizing a right of eminent domain in the federal government
and sanctioning the federal incorporation of railway
and bridge companies, are conclusive authority that Congress
had the power which the more liberal of its members
asserted, but which the states and occasional executives
denied. That the power to <i>establish</i> postroads comprehends
the power to <i>construct</i> (compensation being made to the
states), to levy tolls, and to repair and keep free from
obstructions, has thus been assured by judicial decisions as
well as by a fair interpretation of the words of the grant;
and any fancied taint of unconstitutionality has been removed
from laws which Congress passed under its plenary
power “to establish postroads,” but which exceeded the
limitations laid down by the strict constructionists, and
did not come before the Supreme Court for a determination
of their validity.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Limitations on the Postal Power</span></span></h2>

<p>Like all grants to Congress, the postal power is not unrestrained,
but, as the Supreme Court has expressed it, the
difficulty in setting limits beyond which it may not go, arises,
“not from want of power in Congress to prescribe the
regulations as to what shall constitute mail matter, but from
the necessity of enforcing them consistently with the rights
reserved to the people, of far greater importance than the
transportation of the mail.”<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> One, and perhaps the most
important, of these rights is involved when restrictions are
applied to periodical publications (particularly in reference
to obscene matter and lottery tickets), and the question is at
once raised as to the freedom of the press, guaranteed
against abridgment by the second clause of the first amendment
to the Federal Constitution.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> The extent to which this
limitation has been ignored is a moot question. On the one
hand, we have the confident assertion of Von Holst<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> that
“the freedom of the press has become a part of the flesh
and blood of the American people to such an extent, and is
so conditioned by the democratic character of their political
and social life, that a successful attack upon it, no matter
what legal authority it might have on its side, is impossible.
Even the gigantic power of slavocracy gave up the battle as
hopeless after the first onslaught.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, Hannis Taylor in his recent work on
the American Constitution remarks that “little need be said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
as to the clause forbidding Congress to pass any law
‘abridging the freedom of the press,’ as that clause has been
removed from the Constitution, so far as the mails are concerned,
by the judgment rendered in 1892, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">In Re Rapier</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a>
And this extreme view may be said to have received some
support from a recent decision of the Supreme Court which
upheld the power of Congress to compel newspapers to publish
certain information concerning their internal affairs,
under penalty, for refusal, of being denied the advantages
of low second class rates.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> Which, then, is the correct view
as to the inviolability or abrogation of this constitutional
guarantee in relation to the mails?</p>

<p id="fotp"><i>Freedom of the Press.</i>&mdash;In the Convention which framed
the Federal Constitution, Mr. Pinckney, on August 20, 1787,
submitted a number of propositions among which was a
guarantee that “the liberty of the Press shall be inviolably
preserved.”<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> The propositions were referred to the Committee
of Detail, and when the question again came up for
consideration on September 14, Mr. Pinckney and Mr.
Gerry “moved to insert a declaration that the liberty of the
Press should be inviolably observed.” This motion was
lost, Mr. Sherman remarking that “it is unnecessary. The
power of Congress does not extend to the Press.”<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a></p>

<p>During the discussion of the Constitution by the States,
however, the absence of a guarantee of the freedom of the
press was frequently adverted to. Speaking in the South
Carolina House of Representatives, Mr. C.&nbsp;C. Pinckney
said:</p>

<p>“With regard to the liberty of the press, the discussion of
that matter was not forgotten by the members of the Convention.
It was fully debated, and the impropriety of saying
anything about it in the Constitution clearly evinced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
The general government has no powers but what are expressly
granted to it; it therefore has no power to take away
the liberty of the press. That invaluable blessing which
deserves all the encomiums the gentleman has justly bestowed
upon it, is secured by all our state constitutions; and
to have it mentioned in our general Constitution would
perhaps furnish an argument, hereafter, that the general
government had a right to exercise powers not expressly
delegated to it.”<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></p>

<p>A different theory was advanced by Hamilton, who, answering
the objection that the Constitution contained no bill
of rights, and treating specifically the absence of any provision
safeguarding the press, asked: “What signifies a
declaration that ‘the liberty of the press shall be inviolably
preserved?’ What is the liberty of the press? Who can
give it any definition which would not leave the utmost latitude
for evasion? I hold it to be impracticable; and from
this I infer that its security, whatever fine declarations may
be inserted in any Constitution respecting it, must altogether
depend upon public opinion, and on the general spirit of the
people and of the government....”<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
A proposal to guarantee the freedom of the press was,
however, a part of the plan for a bill of rights which
Madison introduced in Congress on June 8, 1789.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> Such a
federal provision had been suggested by the ratifying conventions
of three states, and similar provisions were contained
in nine state constitutions.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> Madison’s proposal was
amended until it provided that “the freedom of speech and
of the press ... shall not be infringed” and its language
was further modified until it took the form in which it
became a part of the Constitution.</p>

<p>Concerning the meaning of the amendment at the time of
its adoption, there has been little, if any controversy, in spite
of Hamilton’s declaration to the contrary. Blackstone had
announced a generally accepted rule when he said that
the liberty of the press “consists in laying no <i>previous</i> restraint
upon publications, and not in freedom from censure
for criminal matter when published. Every freeman has
an undoubted right to lay what sentiments he pleases before
the public; to forbid this, is to destroy the freedom of the
press; but if he publishes what is improper, mischievous, or
illegal, he must take the consequence of his own temerity....
To punish (as the law does at present) any dangerous
or offensive writings, which, when published, shall, on a
fair and impartial trial be adjudged of a pernicious tendency,
is necessary for the preservation of the peace and
good order, of government and religion, the only foundations
of civil liberty.”<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a></p>

<p>In the celebrated case of People v. Croswell, Alexander
Hamilton appearing as counsel for the traverser, laid down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
the following rule which was unsupported by the English
common law, but which has been accepted as a proper definition
by a number of the present-day state constitutions.
Hamilton said:</p>

<p>“The liberty of the press consists, in my idea, in publishing
the truth, from good motives, and for justifiable ends,
though it reflect on the government, on magistrates, or individuals....
It is essential to say, not only that the measure
is bad and deleterious, but to hold up to the people who is
the author, that in this our free and elective government, he
may be removed from the seat of power.”<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> And Story
was of the opinion that the guarantee “is neither more nor
less, than an expansion of the great doctrine, recently
brought into operation in the law of libel, that every man
shall be at liberty to publish what is true, with good motives,
and for justifiable ends.”<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></p>

<p>The amendment guaranteeing the freedom of the press
has never been before the Supreme Court of the United
States in such a manner that a comprehensive consideration
of its meaning and effect has been entered upon. This is
true even of those cases in which the issue was as to the
constitutionality of laws denying newspapers the use of the
mails for various reasons.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> In fact, the most important
<i>dictum</i> of the Supreme Court occurs in a case where a
federal law was not involved, the Court adopting Blackstone’s
definition and holding that “the main purpose of
such constitutional provisions is to ‘prevent all such <i>previous
restraints</i> upon publications as had been practised by other
governments,’ and they do not prevent subsequent punishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
of such as may be deemed contrary to the public
welfare.”<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></p>

<p>The cases, as well as the text-writers, seem to settle that
the first amendment to the Federal Constitution announced
no new principles; it must be interpreted in reference to its
meaning at common law. The principal inhibition upon the
legislature is in the enactment of <i>previous restraints</i>, but
even here not absolutely. By the civil law of libel, as it
was when the Constitution was adopted, the one publishing
had to answer for personal wrongs, and the criminal law
could punish for defamatory, obscene, blasphemous or seditious
libels. To this extent, there could be, and, in fact,
were, previous restraints.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a></p>

<p>But a recent writer, after an able consideration of the
early declarations in the light of their history, comes to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
conclusion that “they obliterated the English common-law
test of supposed bad tendency to determine the seditious or
blasphemous character of a publication, and hence obliterated
the English common-law crimes of sedition and blasphemy;
shifted the law of obscene and immoral publications from
the region of libel to the region of public nuisance; and left
standing only the law of defamatory publications, materially
modifying that.” Professor Schofield goes on to say that
“the declarations wiped out the English common-law rule
in criminal prosecutions of defamatory libel, ‘The greater
the truth the greater the libel,’” and “threw on American
judges in civil and criminal actions for defamatory libel the
new work of determining what is truth in a publication on
a matter of public concern.” The correct view, in this
author’s opinion, is that “if liberty of the press in the First
Amendment means anything it legalizes published truth on
all matters of public concern.”<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> Without, however, attempting
to pass judgment on Professor Schofield’s criticism
of the cases, it will be possible, from either view, to ascertain
whether the freedom of the press has ever been abridged
by the denial of the use of the mails (for freedom of publication
includes, although perhaps not absolutely, freedom of
circulation), and to set the limits of congressional action.</p>

<p>Not until 1836 was there any serious discussion of the
meaning of the phrase “liberty of the press” and the limitations
it might impose upon the postal regulations which
Congress had the power to make.<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> But during this year
an exhaustive debate took place in the Senate as a result of
President Jackson’s message (December 2, 1835) urging
the enactment of legislation to check the incendiary publications
with which the Northern abolitionists were flooding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
the slave states. The evil complained of was serious, and
the states were making strenuous objections to the continued
presence in the mails of such literature.</p>

<p>On July 29, 1835, for example, the <i>Southern Patriot</i> of
Charleston, S.&nbsp;C., complained that the mails from the North
were “literally overburthened with the newspaper called
‘The Emancipator’ and two tracts entitled ‘The Anti-Slavery
Record’ and ‘The Slaves’ Friend,’” This was declared
a “monstrous abuse of the public mail” and the
publications were denounced as moral poison, the <i>Patriot</i>
adding: “If the general post office is not at liberty [to
prevent circulation], <i>it is impossible to answer for the
security of the mail in this portion of the country</i>, which
contains such poisonous and inflammatory matter.”<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> The
Charleston postoffice was in fact entered, and this particular
consignment of papers destroyed. “Extreme cases require
extreme remedies,” said the <i>Patriot</i>, and the Charleston
<i>Mercury</i> went so far as to predict that anyone violating the
South Carolina law against circulation “would assuredly
expiate his offence on the gallows.”<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> Practically all of the
Southern States had extremely stringent statutes and several
provided capital punishment for offenders.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a></p>

<p>This occurrence at Charleston led Samuel L. Gouverneur,
postmaster at New York, to suggest to Amos Kendall, the
postmaster general, that the transmission of such papers be
suspended, but Arthur Tappan, president of the American
Anti-slavery Society, declined to surrender “any rights or
privileges which we possess in common with our fellow
citizens in regard to the use of the United States mail.”<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Local postmasters nevertheless began to take matters in
their own hands. In regard to the detention of incendiary
matter by the Charleston postoffice, Kendall wrote:</p>

<p>“I am satisfied that the postmaster general has no legal
authority to exclude newspapers from the mail, nor prohibit
their carriage or delivery on account of their character or
tendency, real or supposed....</p>

<p>“The post office department was created to serve the people
of <i>each</i> and <i>all</i> of the United States and not to be used as
the instrument of their <i>destruction</i>.... Entertaining these
views, I cannot sanction and will not condemn the step you
have taken. Your justification must be looked for in the
character of the papers detained, and the circumstances by
which you are surrounded.”<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> Kendall left it to the discretion
of the local postmasters as to whether they would
carry out their official duties, or obey the laws of the local
jurisdictions.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></p>

<p>It was, therefore, no surprise when Jackson adverted to
the situation, and in his annual message asked for legislation
denying such publications the facilities of the postoffice.
President Jackson wrote:</p>

<p>“I must also invite your attention to the painful excitement
produced in the south, by the attempts to circulate,
through the mails, inflammatory appeals addressed to the
passions of the slaves, in prints, and in various sorts of
publications, calculated to stimulate them to insurrection
and to produce all the horrors of a servile war....</p>

<p>“In leaving the care of other branches of this interesting
subject to the state authorities, to whom they properly belong,
it is nevertheless proper for Congress to take such
measures as will prevent the post office department, which
was designed to foster an amicable intercourse and correspondence
between all members of the confederacy, from
being used as an instrument of the opposite character. The
general government to which the great trust is confided of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
preserving inviolate the relations created among the states
by the Constitution is especially bound to avoid, in its own
action, anything that may disturb them. I would, therefore,
call the special attention of Congress to the subject, and
respectfully suggest the propriety of passing such a law as
will prohibit, under severe penalties, the circulation in the
southern states, through the mail, of incendiary publications
intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection.”<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a></p>

<p>On December 21, 1835, Calhoun moved that “so much
of the President’s message as relates to the transmission of
incendiary publications by the United States mail be referred
to a special committee.” King of Alabama expressed
the opinion of several that the regular standing committee
on postoffices would do, since he “felt a confident
belief that there was no disposition in any of its members
to have the public mails prostituted to a set of fanatics.”
Preston of South Carolina thought that a solution of the evil
could be arrived at by a method other than barring the publications
from the mail. He proposed “that the depositing
of an incendiary publication in the post office should be constituted
an offence in the state where it took place, and the
letting of it out of the post office should be equally deemed
an offence where it occurred.”<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> Nevertheless, Calhoun’s
view prevailed and the message was referred to a select
committee of which he was made chairman.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> An elaborate
report written by him was presented to the Senate on February
4, 1836,<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> but with the unqualified concurrence of
only one fellow committeeman. The others opposed, either
any federal action at all, Calhoun’s theory as to the remedy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
or some of the details of the measure which was recommended.</p>

<p>The committee’s report was based upon the premise that
Congress had not the power to pass legislation in accordance
with the President’s recommendation to exclude the objectionable
publications from the mails; such a law, Calhoun
thought, “would be a violation of one of the most sacred
provisions of the Constitution, and subversive of reserved
powers essential to the preservation of the domestic institutions
of the slaveholding states, and with them, of their
peace and security.” This would be closely analogous to the
Sedition Act which made it a crime to print “any false,
scandalous and malicious writing or writings, against the
government of the United States,” or Congress, or the
President, “with intent to defame ... or to bring them
... into contempt or disrepute ... or to incite against
them, or either of them, the hatred of the good people of
the United States.”<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a></p>

<p>But, said Calhoun, postulating the unconstitutionality of
these provisions, “as abridging the freedom of the press,
<i>which no one now doubts</i>, it will not be difficult to show
that if, instead of inflicting punishment for publishing, the
act had inflicted punishment for circulating through the
mails for the same offence, it would have been equally unconstitutional
... To prohibit circulation, is in effect, to
prevent publication ... each is equally an abridgment of
the freedom of the press.</p>

<p>“The prohibition of any publication on the ground of its
being immoral, irreligious, or intended to excite rebellion
or insurrection, would have been equally unconstitutional;
and, from parity of reason, the suppression of their circulation
through the mail would be no less so.”<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></p>

<p>The fallacy of this is evident. So far as the Sedition Act
is concerned, there are two grounds upon which it could be
attacked: lack of congressional power to punish sedition,
and abridgment of the freedom of the press. The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
question, for present purposes, needs no discussion;<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> but,
as for the second, it is well settled that punishment for seditious,
obscene, defamatory and blasphemous publications, is
not in violation of the freedom of the press.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> In the
United States, then, there is no constitutional restriction
which will compel the government impotently to remain the
subject of attacks upon its stability. The Act of 1798 was
very broad and objectionable on this ground, but the prohibition
of seditious utterances urging the use of force or
unlawful means to overthrow the government or falsely
defamatory of federal officers would not infringe any provision
of the bill of rights.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
But legislation of the character urged by Jackson was not on
all fours with the Sedition Act, for by that act the government
was punishing publications which it deemed inimical
to its own safety. The incendiary matter, however, concerned
the states and only a portion of them; the power of
Congress to prohibit it, therefore, was doubtful, unless the
evil reached such proportions that the menace to the states
was a menace to the federal government. To Calhoun it
seemed also that the prohibition of circulation through the
mails was tantamount to a prohibition of publication.</p>

<p>The right “to determine what papers are incendiary,” the
report argued, and as such to “prohibit their circulation
through the mail, necessarily involves the right to determine
what are not incendiary and to enforce their circulation”;
both were matters of state prerogative. And, if “consequently
the right to protect her internal peace and security
belongs to a state, the general government is bound to respect
the measures adopted by her for that purpose, and to
cooperate in their execution, as far as its delegated powers
may admit, or the measure may require. Thus, in the
present case, the slaveholding states having the unquestionable
right to pass all such laws as may be necessary to
maintain the existing relation between master and slave in
those states, their right, of course, to prohibit the circulation
of any publication or intercourse calculated to disturb or
destroy that relation is incontrovertible.” The general government
is bound, “in conformity to the principle established,
to respect the laws of the state in their exercise, and
so to modify its act as not only not to violate those of the
stated, but as far as practicable, to cooperate in their
execution.”</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the presentation of this report,
Calhoun introduced a bill, framed in accordance with his
views, making it unlawful for any postmaster to receive and
put in the mail any publication addressed to a jurisdiction
where its circulation was forbidden. It was made a crime
to deliver such prohibited mail to any person not “duly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
authorized ... to receive the same” by the local authorities,
and there was a further provision that the laws of the
United States should not be allowed to protect any postmaster
accused of violating local regulations. By this
means, Calhoun thought to preserve the liberty of the press
and hand the matter over to the states for their settlement.<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a></p>

<p>The constitutional questions involved in the report and
law proposed gave rise to a debate of such importance that
it has several times been referred to by the Supreme Court
of the United States in passing on partially analogous
matters.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> Many different views were advanced as to the
correct interpretation of the postal grant which at this time
had received practically no consideration by the judiciary.
Webster, for example, contended that the proposed law
“conflicted with that provision of the Constitution which
prohibited Congress from passing any law to abridge the
freedom of speech or of the press. What was the liberty
of the press?” he asked. “It was the liberty of printing as
well as the liberty of publishing, in all the ordinary modes
of publication; and was not the circulation of papers through
the mails an ordinary mode of publication?... Congress
might, under this example, be called upon to pass laws to
suppress the circulation of political, religious, or any other
description of publications which produced excitement in
the states.” Finally, he argued, “Congress had not the
power, drawn from the character of the paper, to decide
whether it should be carried in the mail or not; for such
decision would be a direct abridgment of the freedom of the
press.”<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a></p>

<p>Clay argued to the same effect, considering the bill uncalled
for by public sentiment, unconstitutional, and containing
“a principle of a most dangerous and alarming character.”<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a>
Buchanan’s views, however, were different. “It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
was one thing [he said] not to restrain or punish publications;
it was another and an entirely different thing to carry
and circulate them after they have been published. The one
is merely passive, the other is active. It was one thing to
leave our citizens entirely free to print and publish and
circulate as they pleased; and it was another thing to call
upon us to aid in their circulation. From the prohibition
to make any law ‘abridging the freedom of speech or of
the press,’ it could never be inferred that we must provide
by law for the circulation through the post office of everything
which the press might publish.”<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a></p>

<p>Senator Davis of Massachusetts charged, quite properly,
it seems to me, that the report and bill were in conflict, since
“the report sets forth that Congress has no power to make a
law to restrain the circulation of incendiary papers through
the mail, because the post masters have no right to determine
what is and what is not incendiary; and because to shut
papers out of the mail, would be an invasion of the liberty
of the press.” But the bill would have the United States
adopt and enforce state laws prohibiting the circulation of
incendiary papers, “having constitutional power so to do
and being bound in duty so to do.”<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> Another difficulty, as
Davis went on to say, was “that incendiary matter is anything
unfavorable to slavery. The general principle urged
by the Senator from Carolina is, that where the states have
power to legislate, the United States is bound to carry into
execution their laws. They have the power to prohibit the
circulation of incendiary matter, and therefore Congress
ought to aid that power.”</p>

<p>But to this “there are insurmountable difficulties. How
and by whom, is this law to be executed? Who is to determine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
and in what manner, whether the Constitution of
Massachusetts, which declares that all men are born free
and equal, or the Declaration of Independence ... touch
the subject of slavery or are incendiary? Whoever holds
this power may shut up the great channels of inter-communication;
may obstruct the great avenues through which
intelligence is disseminated.”<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a></p>

<p>The use of the mail was declared by Mr. Morris of Ohio
to be “a reserved right, with which no law ought to interfere,
and not a governmental machine which Congress can
withdraw at pleasure or render nugatory by the acts of its
officers.” Mr. King raised the question as to federal enforcement
of circulation in the states against their will. It
would depend, he said, on the character of the paper. “If
it were a commercial letter ... or any other paper connected
with the granted powers and social relations, as
established by the Constitution, and not inconsistent with
the reserved rights of the states, in that case its circulation
might be enforced. If of a different character it could not
be enforced, and the states whose acknowledged rights might
be affected, could interfere and arrest the circulation.”<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a></p>

<p>This debate, although exhaustive, was inconclusive, and
some of the opinions expressed seem, in the light of present
day construction of the postal clause, almost absurd. Considerably
changed, Calhoun’s bill came up for a vote on June
8, 1836, and failed of passage. In its amended form, the
bill no longer required that postmasters know the laws of the
places to which the mail they received was directed. Under
a penalty of being removed from office, they were forbidden
to deliver publications, the circulation of which was prohibited
by local laws, and in the event that state regulations
were not regarded, it was provided that “nothing in the acts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
of Congress shall be construed” so as to furnish immunity
from prosecution.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a></p>

<p>There is much to be said in favor of this bill as amended.
To make their postal agents amenable to local laws as regards
the distribution of certain matter is surely within the
constitutional power of Congress, and the aim should constantly
be for the federal government to legislate so that
national and local statutes will be harmonized. “It must be
kept in mind,” the Supreme Court has said, “that we are
one people and that the powers reserved to the states and
those conferred on the nation, are adapted to be exercised,
whether independently or concurrently, to promote the general
welfare, material and moral.”<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> In several instances
this <i>dictum</i> of the Court has been effectuated.</p>

<p>The Judiciary Act of 1789<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> adopted “the laws of the
several states” as “rules of decision in trials at common law
in courts of the United States in cases where they apply.”<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a>
Quarantine and pilotage regulations have been freely made
by the states.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> During Mr. Jefferson’s administration (and
this was a precedent relied upon by Calhoun), Congress
passed a law forbidding the transportation of free negroes
from one state into any other where by local laws they were
not permitted to reside.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> The constitutionality of this act
was sustained by Chief Justice Marshall.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> So also, the
congressional act providing for publicity of campaign expenditures
forbids any candidate for Representative in Congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
or for Senator of the United States to “use money in
violation of the laws of the state in which he resides,”<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> and
Congress has adopted and enforced, as its own, state laws
governing elections to the House.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> Finally, in spite of the
constitutional requirement that bankruptcy laws must be
uniform, Congress has permitted great variance among the
several states, their regulations being enforced by the federal
courts. To this there is no constitutional objection.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a></p>

<p>There is, thus, a considerable body of analogous authority
in support of Calhoun’s bill as amended. In its first form,
the law he proposed was open to objection in that it required
deputy postmasters to know the regulations of jurisdictions
other than their own, and its effect was to exclude from the
mails incendiary matter which the receiving postmaster
thought would be considered objectionable at its destination.
Under the amended act, however, there would be
uniformity, since everything would be transmitted, the restriction
being only as to circulation within the states. In
administering a great governmental establishment, it should
be the aim of Congress not to interfere with the exercise by
the states of powers reserved to them.</p>

<p>But Calhoun’s argument that the denial of postal facilities
was tantamount to a denial of the right of publication,
is not well founded, as the Supreme Court of the United
States has been at pains to point out; nevertheless it is true
that, in some measure at least, the First Amendment insures
a use of the postoffice.<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> Whether, if Congress had passed
legislation excluding the incendiary literature from the mails,
absolutely, the constitutional guarantee of a free press would
have been violated, depends upon the character of the publications.
If they were of such a seditious tendency that
their menace of established institutions in the states was a
menace to the federal government, if they fomented disorder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
and proposed to abolish slavery otherwise than by
law, their utterance could have been prohibited, and the
denial of postal facilities would have been constitutional.
Or, if the objectionable publications did not affect the general
government, but incited to arson, murder, etc., and were
not simply political appeals, they could have been excluded,
and there would have been no infringement of the freedom
of the press. But the power of Congress did not extend to
the denunciation of anything unfavorable to slavery; freedom
of circulation could not be denied publications unless
they fell within the limits stated above.</p>

<p>The views expressed in this debate on Calhoun’s bill were
urged before the Supreme Court of the United States with
considerable force when it was called upon to determine the
constitutionality of the act excluding lottery tickets from the
mails. The prevailing opinion in the senatorial debate had
been, as we have seen, that Congress did not possess the
power to prohibit the carriage in the mails of the incendiary
publications, and to this citation of authority the Supreme
Court replied:</p>

<p>“Great reliance is placed by the petitioner upon these
views, coming as they did in many instances, from men
alike distinguished as jurists and statesmen. But it is evident
that they were founded upon the assumption that it is
competent for Congress to prohibit the transportation of
newspapers and pamphlets over postal routes in any other
way than by mail; and of course, it would follow, that if
with such a prohibition, the transportation in the mail could
also be forbidden, the circulation of the documents would
be destroyed and a fatal blow given to the freedom of the
press. But we do not think that Congress possesses the
power to prevent the transportation in other ways, as merchandise,
of matter which it excludes from the mails. To
give efficiency to its regulations and prevent rival postal
systems, it may, perhaps, prohibit the carriage by others for
hire, over postal routes, of articles which legitimately constitute
mail matter, in the sense in which those terms were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
used when the Constitution was adopted,&mdash;consisting of
letters, and of newspapers and pamphlets, when not sent
as merchandise,&mdash;but further than this its power of prohibition
cannot extend.”</p>

<p>And in making a bare denial of the charge that the law
abridged the liberty of the press, the Court went on to say:</p>

<p>“In excluding various articles from the mail, the object
of Congress has not been to interfere with the freedom of
the press, or with any other rights of the people, but to
refuse its facilities for the distribution of matter deemed
injurious to the public morals....</p>

<p>“Nor can any regulations be enforced against the transportation
of printed matter in the mail, which is open to
examination, so as to interfere in any manner with the
freedom of the press. <i>Liberty of circulating is as essential
to that freedom as liberty of publishing; indeed, without the
circulation, the publication would be of little value. If,
therefore, printed matter be excluded from the mails, its
transportation in any other way cannot be forbidden by
Congress.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></p>

<p>In 1890 Congress extended the inhibition to “any newspaper,
circular, pamphlet, or publication of any kind, containing
any advertisement of any lottery,” and again the
Supreme Court held that there had been no impairment of
the freedom of the press. The Court said:</p>

<p>“We cannot regard the right to operate a lottery as a
fundamental right infringed by the legislation in question;
nor are we able to see that Congress can be held, in its enactment,
to have abridged the freedom of the press. The
circulation of newspapers is not prohibited, but the government
declines itself to become an agent in the circulation of
printed matter which it regards as injurious to the people.
The freedom of communication is not abridged within the
intent and meaning of the constitutional provision unless
Congress is absolutely destitute of any discretion as to what
shall, or shall not be carried in the mails, and compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
arbitrarily to assist in the dissemination of matter condemned
by its judgment, through the governmental agencies
which it controls. That power may be abused furnishes
no ground for a denial of its existence, if government is to
be maintained at all.”<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a></p>

<p>It should be remarked that in these cases the reasoning
was largely based on the assumption that prohibiting circulation
through the mails was not equivalent to prohibiting
publication, and Congress could thus deny postal facilities
to matter which it deemed injurious to the people, without
interfering with the liberty of the press, since transportation
between the states, outside of the mails, would still be possible.
But it would seem that this doctrine was repudiated,
inferentially at least, when the Supreme Court upheld the
law excluding lottery tickets from interstate commerce,<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a>
and it would, therefore, it seems to me, have been far better
if the Court, in the first instance, had adopted other reasoning.
It could have held that the liberty of the press suffered
abridgment by a denial of postal facilities, but that lottery
advertisements, by common opinion, had become as objectionable
as immoral writings, and that the latter class,&mdash;an
exception to the common law guarantee,&mdash;could, by
reason of a developing moral sense, be made to include the
former. Or the Court could have announced as a rule what
is probably true, independent of judicial acceptance, that
the freedom of the press does not include freedom of advertisement.
Or, to advert to the view of Professor Schofield,
if the First Amendment protects only publications
which have an educational value on matters of national
public concern, lottery advertisements do not come within
this class; nor do obscene writings.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> Any one of these
theories would have permitted the Supreme Court to render<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
a logical decision, without putting forth a <i>dictum</i> that Congress
could not prevent the transportation in other ways of
matter excluded from the mails, for this would be a check
on circulation which would be a check on publication, and
then being forced to take a contrary position in order to
declare constitutional a statute which exercised the very
power that the Court had doubted. Calhoun’s contention,
therefore, seems to be the more logical. As it was, the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ratio decidendi</i> of the Court in the Jackson and Rapier cases
would have been impossible had the restraint been against
writings of an admittedly innocuous character, against political
opinions, for example, or against matters not so universally
condemned under the police power. And, to repeat,
the Court was forced to deny what, I think, is undoubtedly
the better doctrine,&mdash;that the liberty of the press may be
abridged by restrictions on the use of the mails,&mdash;a doctrine
that will probably be returned to if Congress legislates on
publications that are unobjectionable.</p>

<p>The question of anarchistic publications and the postoffice
was raised in March, 1908, when President Roosevelt wrote
to Attorney General Bonaparte:</p>

<p>“By my direction the Postmaster General is to exclude <i>La
Questione Sociale</i>, of Paterson, N.&nbsp;J., from the mails, and
it will not be admitted to the mails, unless by order of the
court, or unless you advise me that it must be admitted.”<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></p>

<p>In reply to the President’s letter, Secretary Bonaparte
wrote:</p>

<p>“I am obliged to report that I can find no express provision
of law directing the exclusion of such matter from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
mails, or rendering its deposit in the mails an offense against
the United States”; but “I have the honor to advise you
that it is clearly and fully within the power of Congress to
exclude from the mails publications” such as <i>La Questione
Sociale</i>, “and to make the use, or attempted use, of the mails
for the transmission of such writings a crime against the
United States.”</p>

<p>What Congress thought of anarchy, Mr. Bonaparte said,
was shown by the Act of March 7, 1907,<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> excluding and
providing for the deportation of anarchists, and the Attorney
General made this implied expression of legislative
authority (even though in 1903 Congress had expressly refused
to pass a law directed against anarchistic publications)
a sufficient basis to legalize the action of the President
and exclude newspapers which advocated the opinions
quoted. The Attorney General’s opinion concluded:</p>

<p>“In the absence of any express provision of law or binding
adjudication on this precise point, ... I advise you
that, in my opinion, the Postmaster General will be justified
in excluding from the mails any issue of any periodical,
otherwise entitled to the privileges of second class mail
matter, which shall contain any article constituting a seditious
libel and counselling such crimes as murder, arson, riot,
and treason.”</p>

<p>Such action, the opinion said, would be perfectly safe,
since “it is well settled that at common law the owner of a
libelous picture or placard or document of any kind is
entitled to no damages for its destruction in so far at least
as its value may depend on its unlawful significance.”
Hence the federal statutes which provide punishment for
postmasters who may “unlawfully detain” or “improperly
detain” mailable matter, would not operate.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
As a matter of fact, the newspaper was excluded for
reasons other than its contents, but President Roosevelt
transmitted the Attorney General’s opinion to Congress and
in a special message said:</p>

<p>“Under this opinion I hold that the existing statutes give
the President power to prohibit the Postmaster General
from being used as an instrument in the commission of
crime; that is, to prohibit the use of the mails for the
advocacy of murder, arson, and treason; and I shall act
upon such construction. Unquestionably, however, there
should be further legislation by Congress in this matter.
When compared with the suppression of anarchy, every
other question sinks into insignificance.” Congress has
since acted by declaring that the term “indecent” in the
section against obscene writings, should include “matter of
a character tending to incite arson, murder or assassination.”<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a></p>

<p>The Attorney General in his opinion, it may be remarked,
did not mention the freedom of the press, and this question
was not involved. From what has already been said, it
follows that there is no question as to the competency of
Congress to pass legislation designed to deny the mails to
anarchistic publications if they incite to crime. But the
Attorney General’s argument as to the power of the President
was not well founded; it granted to an administrative
officer arbitrary discretion based on no explicit or
implied legislative authority, and sanctioned the exercise of
this power on the ground that the one injured could have
no legal redress. It is, however, simply a question of
whether the exclusion was <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ultra vires</i>, not whether it was
an abridgment of the freedom of the press.<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
The latest question of the freedom of the press was considered
by the Supreme Court in 1913 when it sustained
the so-called “newspaper publicity law.” This required
publications entered as second class matter (with a few
exceptions) to furnish the postoffice department with, and
publish semi-annually, a sworn statement of their editors
and owners, in addition to marking as an advertisement anything
for the publication of which, compensation is received.
Newspapers were also required to give information as to
their circulation figures.<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></p>

<p>The law was vigorously assailed as being <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ultra vires</i>, as
denying due process of law, and as impairing the freedom
of the press. It “establishes,” said one of the counsel, “a
governmental control over newspaper publishers and dictates
to them what shall or shall not be published and the manner,
form, and time of publishing. In other words, Congress in
plain language provided that matter inherently proper and
mailable shall be unmailable, not on account of any inherent
defect, but solely because the publisher may refuse or neglect
to advise the public of certain of his private matters as to
which Congress seems to desire the public to be informed.
This is not regulation, but paternalism, and a direct and
positive abridgment of the freedom of the press.”<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a></p>

<p>The Supreme Court, however, by a narrow line of reasoning,
sustained the statute, the opinion showing that in order
to receive “entry” as second class matter and get the
benefit of low rates, the publication must answer a number
of questions concerning ownership, editorial supervision,
circulation, sample copies, and advertising discrimination.
The Court considered the new law as simply laying down
additional conditions, compliance with which would enable
the publishers to continue “to enjoy great privileges and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
advantages at the public expense.” The Court went on
to say:</p>

<p>“This being true, the attack on the provision in question
as a violation of the Constitution because infringing the
freedom of the press and depriving of property without
due process of law, rests only upon the illegality of the
conditions which the provision exacts in return for the
right to enjoy the privileges and advantages of the second
class mail classification. The question, therefore, is only
this: Are the conditions which were exacted incidental to
the power exerted of conferring on the publishers of newspapers,
periodicals, etc., the privileges of the second class
classification, or are they so beyond the scope of the exercise
of that power as to cause the conditions to be repugnant
to the Constitution? We may say this is the question, since
necessarily if the power exists to legislate by discriminating
in favor of the publishers, the right to exercise that power
carries with it the authority to do those things which are
incidental to the power itself, or which are plainly necessary
to make effective the principal authority when
exerted.”<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a></p>

<p>Whether this reasoning seems convincing or not, it must
nevertheless be conceded that legislation to the same effect,
not based upon the power of Congress over the mails, would
be unconstitutional, and that in this case, Congress has
been permitted to do by indirection what it has not the power
directly to accomplish. The step is a short one to requiring,
for a continuance of the low second class rates, that newspapers
print, or refrain from printing, reading matter of a
specified character. The decision, however, lends no support
to the belief that if this indirect regulation is carried
further, or if there is a real interference with the freedom
of the press, the Supreme Court will not intervene.</p>

<p>Such are the incidents in which the liberty of the press
has figured, and it is difficult to see how it has ever been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
abridged. The executive order of President Roosevelt excluding
<i>La Questione Sociale</i> from the mails was <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ultra vires</i>,
but, as Attorney General Bonaparte pointed out, the injured
parties had slight chance of a remedy at law. Certain
it is that the paper in question was so seditious that
under a state statute publication could have been stopped,
and that an Act of Congress, forbidding such periodicals
the privilege of the mails, would not have been in violation
of the First Amendment.</p>

<p>The decisions of the Supreme Court which have been
quoted lead to no conclusion other than that any attempt
on the part of Congress to place a previous restraint upon
the press, or even to deny it postal facilities, for no discernible
reason, would receive a judicial veto. The exclusion
of lottery tickets, obscene matter, and other writings inimical
to the public morals, has been clearly within the power of
Congress, and legislation forbidding seditious and anarchistic
publications when directed against the federal
government, or banning them from the mails, would be
constitutional. It is true that the “newspaper publicity
law,” strictly speaking, is a previous restraint, but the
Supreme Court considered it as merely laying down additional
and reasonable conditions, compliance with which
would enable periodical publications to continue to enjoy
great and exclusive advantages of second class privileges,&mdash;a
satisfactory, if not conclusive basis for the decision; as
interpreted by the Court, the act promotes, rather than
abridges, the liberty of the press.</p>

<p>Neither reason nor precedent justifies the view, eloquently
urged by counsel in this case, that Congress by the law
exercises “a governmental control over newspaper publishers
and dictates to them what shall not be published, and
the manner, form, and time of publishing.” On the contrary,
that great “palladium of liberty,”&mdash;the freedom of
the press,&mdash;seems to be in no danger of demolition through
congressional action.</p>

<p id="usas"><i>Unreasonable Searches and Seizures.</i>&mdash;As with the freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
of the press, the Supreme Court of the United States
has rarely been asked to restrain the postal power under the
provision of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution
which declares that “the right of the people to be secure in
their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable
searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no
warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by
oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to
be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> The
scope of this limitation, as applied to the mails, has been
described by the Supreme Court in the following terms:</p>

<p>“A distinction is to be made between different kinds of
mail matter, between what is intended to be kept free from
inspection, such as letters and sealed packages, subject to
letter postage, and what is open to inspection.... Letters
and sealed packages of this kind in the mail are to be as
fully guarded from examination and inspection, except as
to their outward form and weight, as if they were retained
by the parties forwarding them in their own domiciles. The
constitutional guaranty of the right of the people to be
secure in their papers against unreasonable searches and
seizures extends to their papers thus closed against inspection,
wherever they may be. Whilst in the mail, they
can only be opened and examined under like warrant, issued
upon similar oath or affirmation, particularly in describing
the thing to be seized, as is required when papers are subjected
to search in one’s own household. No law of Congress
can place in the hands of officials connected with the
postal service any authority to invade the secrecy of letters
and such sealed packages; and all regulations adopted as to
mail matter of this kind must be in subordination to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
great principle embodied in the Fourth Amendment of the
Constitution.”<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a></p>

<p>The limitation operates chiefly upon administrative officials
who attempt to get evidence of violations of the law
regarding obscene literature and fraudulent matter excluded
from the mails. In regard to this the Court said:</p>

<p>“Whilst regulations excluding matter from the mails
cannot be enforced in a way which would require or permit
an examination into letters, or sealed packages subject to
letter postage, without warrant issued upon oath or affirmation,
in the search for prohibited matter, they may be enforced
upon competent evidence of their violation obtained
in other ways; as from parties receiving the letters and
packages, or from agents depositing them in the postoffices,
or others cognizant of the facts. And as to the objectionable
printed matter which is open to examination, the regulations
may be enforced in a similar way, by the imposition
of penalties for their violation through the courts, and,
in some cases by the direct action of the officers of the postal
service. In many instances those officers can act upon their
own inspection, and, from the nature of the case, must act
without other proof; as where the postage is not prepaid, or
where there is an excess of weight over the amount prescribed,
or where the object is exposed, and shows unmistakably
that it is prohibited, as in the case of an obscene
picture or print. In such cases, no difficulty arises, and no
principle is violated in excluding the prohibited articles and
refusing to forward them. The evidence respecting them is
seen by everyone and is in its nature conclusive.”<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a></p>

<p>This view of the law has been acquiesced in by Congress
which has provided that nothing in the acts excluding certain
matters from the mails, “shall be so construed as to
authorize any person other than an employee of the Dead
Letter Office, duly authorized thereto, to open any letter
not addressed to himself.”<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> The regulations promulgated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
for the postoffice department, provide, moreover, that neither
postmasters, inspectors, employees, nor officers of the law,
“without legal warrant therefor, have authority to open
under any pretext a sealed letter while in the mails, not even
though it may contain improper or criminal matter, or
furnish evidence for the conviction of offenders,” and out
of excess of caution, it is further added that “the seal of
letters or packages suspected to contain unmailable matter
shall not be broken to ascertain that fact.”<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> The regulations
provide that matter manifestly unmailable shall be
withdrawn and sent to the Division of Dead Letters with a
statement of the facts upon which such action was taken;
if there is doubt as to the propriety of such disposition, the
matter shall be sent to the Assistant Attorney General for

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Power of the States to Interfere with the Mails</span></span></h2>

<p>In the disputed zone between federal authority and the
reserved rights of the states, interesting and often acute
problems have, of course, frequently developed. The most
important of these have probably been with regard to the
national control of interstate commerce and the police power
of the states, and several times Congress has passed legislation
designed to leave certain subjects within the jurisdiction
of the states or to make local regulations more effective.
In Jefferson’s administration, for example, Congress passed
a law prohibiting the transportation of free negroes from
one state into another where by local laws they were not
permitted to reside;<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> the sale of oleomargarine has been
made subject to local regulations;<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> Congress has forbidden
the transportation of game killed in violation of state laws,<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a>
and has twice enacted legislation to enable the states more
effectively to regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors.<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a>
Such action has been necessary since congressional silence
has been interpreted by the courts as meaning that commerce
between the states shall be free, just as, when Congress
has acted affirmatively, state laws in conflict are
thereby suspended: in both cases the supremacy of the
federal authority is unquestioned. Nevertheless local jurisdictions
have been permitted to exercise a slight measure of
police control.<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a></p>

<p>It would seem evident, at first glance, that, inherently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
the power of Congress over the postal system is even more
paramount than that over interstate commerce, but there
has been practically no judicial determination of the subject,
and as there are only a few incidents in which a conflict
of jurisdiction has taken place, conclusions as to the exclusiveness
of the federal power must be largely speculative.
Some aid, it is true, may be drawn from the analogy of
interstate commerce, but there is the fundamental difference
that postal facilities are established and conducted,
while trade between the states is simply regulated, by Congress.
From this arises the presumption that the mails
are less subject to interference than is interstate trade. Has
this in fact proved to be the case?<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a></p>

<p>The first question as to the rights of the states was
raised in 1812, when the general assembly of the Presbyterian
Church and the Synod of Pittsburgh memorialized
Congress to suspend the carrying and opening of the mails
on Sunday, but, owing to the “peculiar crisis of the United
States” then pending, the petitions were withdrawn and the
House Committee on the Postoffice and Postroads did not
consider the requests on their merits.<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> In practice the
activities were lessened, offices at which the mail arrived
on Sunday being kept open for one hour only, and that not
during the time of public worship. So, the Senate Committee
to which similar memorials were referred, deemed
it inexpedient to make any change, particularly “considering
the condition of the country, engaged in war, rendering
frequent communication through the whole extent of
it absolutely necessary.”<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a></p>

<p>The practice to which objection was made had obtained
since the adoption of the Constitution. By the postal act
passed in 1810<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> it was made a duty of postmasters “at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
reasonable hours, on every day of the week, to deliver”
mail to the proper persons, and since this provision was
reenacted in 1825<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a> protests were still received from a number
of the states in which rigorous Sunday observance laws
had been passed. Upon the memorials which were presented
in 1829 the Senate Committee acted unfavorably, but
the House Committee acceded so far as to propose the
discontinuance of delivery, but the maintenance of transportation;<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a>
the chief objection seemed to be to the keeping
open of the postoffices and not to the carrying of the mails,
for which, it was realized, the greatest possible expedition
was desirable. In 1830 counter memorials opposed “the
interference of Congress upon the ground that it would be
legislating upon a religious subject and therefore unconstitutional,”<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a>
but this argument is clearly untenable, since
Sunday legislation has uniformly been upheld, not upon
religious grounds, but as a valid exercise of the police
power,<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> and Congress certainly has analogous authority so
far as concerns the conduct of government business.</p>

<p>During the whole of this period, however, when certain
localities and religious bodies desired observance of Sunday
by the postoffice, the authority of Congress to make such
regulations as it might see fit for the transportation of the
mails, was not seriously questioned, and the states did not
attempt, under their police power, themselves to take affirmative
action. One of the committee reports suggested, but
did not argue, a contrary proposition when it asked: “If
the arm of the government be necessary to compel respect
and obey the laws of God, do not the state governments
possess infinitely more power in this respect?” But this
implication of authority in the states to interfere with the
postal function is later denied when the committee says that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
in order to insure effective Sabbath observance it should be
made a crime to receive, write, or read letters.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> Congress,
however, is the sole judge of the primary question. As a
House Committee said in 1817: “The power ‘to establish
postoffices and postroads’ is by the Constitution of the
United States exclusively tested in Congress; and the transportation
and distribution of the mail, at such times and
under such circumstances as the public interest may require,
are necessarily incident to that power.”<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a></p>

<p>It should be remembered, however, that the law provided
for delivery “at all reasonable hours, on every day of the
week,” and so the question is different from that decided
by the Supreme Court of the United States in Hennington
v. Georgia,<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> where it was held that a state statute prohibiting
the running of freight trains on Sunday was, in
the absence of congressional regulation of the subject, not
invalid as interfering with interstate commerce. But even
if Congress had not provided for the carriage of the mails
on Sunday, there could be no stoppage under a state statute,
since the subject is one for exclusive federal regulation;
and if the freight trains in the Georgia case had carried
mails, the decision would have been otherwise.
Similarly, the state laws which provide punishment for
working on Sunday are inoperative as applied to postal
employees (in discharge of their duty imposed by federal
regulations) even though the local statute may make no
express exception. The question has rarely come before
the courts, but it has been held a work of necessity to shoe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
horses used by a stage company in transporting the mail.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a>
The work done by postal employees would, therefore, be
necessary within the exemption made by nearly all Sunday
observance laws; but if this were not the case, the laws
would not apply.</p>

<p>Closely allied to this question is that of how far the
states may go in making police regulations, regard for which
will result in a temporary delay of the mails. As early as
1817 it was held by a federal circuit court that a municipal
corporation is competent to prevent the reckless driving of
a mail carrier through crowded streets.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> Of similar import
was the advice given the postoffice department in 1852
by Attorney General Crittenden, that municipal ordinances
prohibiting railroad trains from running at a rate of more
than six miles an hour within the town limits, the mails
thereby being delayed, were valid regulations and not in
conflict with the act of Congress.</p>

<p>“When such regulations,” said the opinion, “are fairly
and discreetly made with intent to preserve the peace, safety
and well being of the inhabitants of the city, they may be
said to flow from powers necessary and proper in themselves,
which the act of Congress does not intend to take
away or impugn.”<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
At later dates the validity of similar regulations requiring
trains to stop at particular points was passed upon by
the United States Supreme Court and the exercise of local
authority was, in several cases, declared inoperative, primarily
upon the ground that it interfered with the freedom
of trade between the states, and the commercial, rather than
the postal, power was relied upon, as in federal incorporation,
to furnish the basis of the court’s decisions. But the
fact that, in many instances, the trains carried the mails
under contracts which required expedition was incidentally
referred to as a further reason for declaring local regulations
invalid.</p>

<p>Thus, when an Illinois statute required an interstate train
to turn aside from the direct route for a stop at a station
three and one half miles away, the Supreme Court held
the requirement to be “an unconstitutional hindrance and
obstruction of interstate commerce and of the passage of the
mails of the United States....</p>

<p>“It may well be, as held by the courts of Illinois, that the
arrangements made by the company with the Postoffice Department
of the United States cannot have the effect of
abrogating a reasonable police regulation of the state. But
a statute of the state, which unnecessarily interferes with the
speedy and uninterrupted carriage of the mails of the United
States, cannot be considered as a reasonable police regulation.”<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a>
And in a later case the court said:</p>

<p>“The fact that the company has contracts to transport
the mails of the United States within a time which requires
great speed for the trains carrying them, while not conclusive,
may still be considered upon the general question
of stopping such trains at certain stations within the boundaries
of a state. The railroad has been recognized by
Congress and is the recipient of large land grants, and the
carrying of the mails is a most important function of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
a road.”<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> The test as laid down by the United States
Supreme Court is, therefore, simply one of reasonableness
and necessity; and the courts, not the legislatures, are to
determine the question.</p>

<p>But there are many cases in which the problem is not so
simple, and where the state regulations are so important
that their violation should not be permitted under the cloak
of federal sanction. Particularly is this true where the
detention of a postal employee is, superficially, forbidden
under the federal statutes, and there arises the dilemma
that either the governmental agent is immune from interference
while in discharge of his duties and at all times
for acts committed in the course of his employment, or
that the national regulations must give way.</p>

<p>For example, from the beginning of congressional activity
under the postal power, there has constantly been a prohibition,
under severe penalties, of any obstruction of the mail.
The federal district court for Maryland considered a case
where stage horses upon which an innkeeper had a lien
were stopped in the public highway while driving a coach
containing the mail. The court held that since the United
States could not be sued, “the defendant could not justify
the stopping of the mail on principles of common law, as
they apply to individuals and to the government.” But,
further, the defendant was not justifiable under the act of
Congress which introduced no exception. “Whether the
acts which it prohibits to be done were lawful or unlawful
before the operation of that law, or independent of it, might
or might not be justified, is not material. This law does
not allow any justification of a <i>wilful and voluntary</i> act of
obstruction to the passage of the mail. If, therefore, courts
or juries were to introduce exceptions not found in the law
itself, by admitting justifications for the breach of the act,
which justifications the act does not allow to be made, it
would be an assumption of legislative power.”<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
And when a warrant in a civil suit was served on a mail
carrier and he was detained thereby, Chief Justice Taney
(on circuit) held that the warrant was not justification to
the traverser, a constable, yet the mere <i>serving</i> “would not
render the party liable, to an indictment under this law.
But if, by serving the warrant, he <i>detained</i> the carrier, he
would then be liable.”<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> Here also the immunity was simply
as to civil proceedings.</p>

<p>But when a carrier, while discharging his duty, was
arrested upon an indictment for murder, and it was argued
that this was an obstruction of the mail within the federal
statute, the Supreme Court refused to listen to the plea,
and held that the law, “by its terms applies only to persons
who ‘knowingly and wilfully’ obstruct the passage of the
mail or of its carrier; that is, to those who know that
the acts performed will have that effect and perform them
with the intention that such shall be their operation. When
the acts which create the obstruction are in themselves
unlawful, the intention to obstruct will be imputed to their
author, although the attainment of other ends may have
been his primary object. The statute has no reference to
acts lawful in themselves, from the execution of which a
temporary delay to the mails unavoidably follows. All
persons in the public service are exempt, as a matter of
public policy, from arrest upon a civil process while thus
engaged. Process of that kind can, therefore, furnish no
justification for the arrest of a carrier of the mail....
The rule is different when the process is issued upon a
charge of felony. No officer or employee of the United
States is placed by his position, or the services he is called
to perform, above responsibility to the legal tribunals of the
country, and to the ordinary processes for his arrest and
detention when accused of a felony, in the forms prescribed
by the Constitution and laws.</p>

<p>“The public inconvenience which may occasionally follow
from the temporary delay in the transmission of the mail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
caused by the arrest of its carriers on such charges is far
less than that which would arise from extending to them
the immunity for which the counsel of the government contends.
Indeed, it may be doubted whether it is competent
for Congress to exempt the employees of the United States
from arrest on criminal process from the state courts when
the crimes charged against them are not merely <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mala prohibita</i>
but are <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mala in se</i>. But whether such legislation
of that character be constitutional or not, no intention to
extend such exemption should be attributed to Congress
unless clearly manifested by its language.”<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a></p>

<p>Thus, the Supreme Court of Maine decided that a mail
carrier, while in the performance of his duties, is liable to
arrest for an offense against the law of the state, even
though it be not a felony but a violation of a liquor regulation,
and the public employment of the carrier will not
justify him in assaulting the officer who serves the warrant.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a>
It was held, further, that preventing a horse from being
taken from the stable for the purpose of carrying the mail
was no offense under the federal law since the mail had to
be <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in transitu</i>.<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a></p>

<p>The attachment, knowingly, of a coach carrying the mail
is void, being an obstruction;<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> but levy on and sale of a
ferryboat used to carry the mail do not constitute an obstruction.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a>
In United States v. De Mott<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a> it was held
that the statute “is applicable to a person stopping a train
carrying the United States mail, although he has obtained
a judgment and writ of possession from a state court against
the railroad company in respect to lands about to be crossed
by such train.” It is, moreover, not a sufficient plea to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
indictment for obstructing the mails, that the defendant was
required by state law to collect tolls in advance from all
drivers of wagons. “It is not the right of the company to
the tolls under the state law which is doubted,” said the
Court, “but the right to stop the passage of the mails to
enforce their collection which is denied.”<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a></p>

<p>The rule may thus be stated to be as follows: In order to
guard against obstruction of the mails, postoffice employees,
while in discharge of their duty, have immunity from interference
on civil processes, but are liable for felonies, and
perhaps, misdemeanors. But a different and more serious
question upon which these cases throw little or no light, is
presented when a postal agent in the discharge of a duty
imposed by federal law (neglect of duty being punishable)
thereby performs an act which has been made criminal by
the state.<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> There are, naturally, but few cases when this
conflict arises, but it is entirely possible, perhaps the most
favorable opportunity being when a postmaster distributes
certain mail matter, the possession or dissemination of which
the state has declared unlawful. This conflict was once
presented very acutely.</p>

<p>In the senatorial debate on Calhoun’s bill to deal with
incendiary publications in the mails, the federal question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
of interference with the freedom of the press received the
greatest attention<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> and the equally important question of
the validity of state legislation was only meagrely considered.
Nearly all of the Southern States had extremely
stringent laws, making the publication, circulation and even
the possession of objectionable literature punishable by
severe penalties. Postal officials were not exempted; in
Virginia they were specifically included.<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> Nevertheless,
the objectionable dissemination continued, and Amos Kendall,
postmaster general, who had left the problem largely
in the hands of local officers,<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> was importuned from many
sources to take decisive action. The citizens of Petersburg,
Va., on August 8, 1835, petitioned him to “adopt such
lawful regulations in his department as may be calculated
to prevent” the dissemination of incendiary papers. More
elaborate resolutions were adopted at Richmond, and at
Charleston it was declared:</p>

<p>“That the postoffice establishment cannot consistently
with the Constitution of the United States and the objects
of such an institution, be converted into an instrument for
the dissemination of incendiary publications, and that it is
the duty of the federal government to provide that it
shall not be so prostituted, which can easily be effected by
merely making it unlawful to transport by the public mail,
through the limits of any state, any seditious papers, forbidden
by the laws of such state, to be introduced or circulated
therein, and by adopting the necessary regulations
to effect the object.” The resolutions then went on to
assert “the right of each state to provide by law against
the introduction of a <i>moral pestilence</i>, calculated to endanger
its existence, and to give authority to their (<i>sic</i>) courts
adequate to the suppression of the evil.”<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
To the Petersburg resolutions, Kendall replied at some
length, very conciliatingly, and pleaded that the discretion
was not vested in him. “Having no official right to decide
upon the character of papers passing through the mails,”
he said, “it is not within my power by any ‘lawful regulation’
to obviate the evil of which the citizens of Petersburg
complain. If any necessity exists for a supervision
over the productions of the press which are transmitted by
mail, all will agree that it ought not to be vested in the head
of the executive department....</p>

<p>“For the present I perceive no means of relief except
in the responsibilities voluntarily assumed by the postmasters
through whose offices the seditious matter passes.”<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a></p>

<p>In a letter to Gouverneur, the postmaster at New York,
who had exercised his discretion in detaining certain publications,
Kendall expressed the same views but argued the
constitutional problems at greater length. “As a measure
of great public necessity,” he said, “you and the other postmasters
who have assumed the responsibility of stopping
these inflammatory papers, will, I have no doubt, stand
justified in that step before your country and all mankind.”
Perhaps also, he suggested, the abolitionists did not have
their imagined clear legal right to the use of the mails for
distributing insurrectionary papers. When the states became
independent, he argued, “they acquired a right to
prohibit the circulation of such papers within their territories;
and their power over the subject of slavery and its
incidents was in no degree diminished by the adoption of
the federal Constitution....</p>

<p>“Now,” he asked, “have these people a legal right to
do by the mail carriers and postmasters of the United States,
acts, which, if done by themselves or their agents, would
lawfully subject them to the punishment due felons of the
deepest dye? Are the officers of the United States compelled
by the Constitution and laws to become the instruments
and accomplices of those who design to baffle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
make nugatory the constitutional laws of the states,&mdash;to fill
them with sedition, murder, insurrection,&mdash;to overthrow
those institutions which are recognized and guaranteed by
the Constitution itself?</p>

<p>“And is it entirely certain that any existing law of the
United States would protect mail carriers and postmasters
against the penalties of the state laws, if they shall knowingly
carry, distribute or hand out any of these forbidden
papers? ... It might be vain for them to plead that the
postoffice law made it their clear duty to deliver all papers
which came by mail. In reply to this argument, it might
be alleged, that the postoffice imposes penalties on postmasters
for ‘<i>improperly</i>’ detaining papers which come by
the mail; and that the detention of the papers in question
is not improper because their circulation is prohibited by
valid state laws. Ascending to a higher principle, it might
be plausibly alleged, that no law of the United States can
protect from punishment any man, whether a public officer
or citizen, in a commission of an act which the state, acting
within the undoubted sphere of her reserved rights has
declared to be a crime.</p>

<p>“Every citizen may use the mail for any lawful purpose.
The abolitionists may have a legal right to its use for distributing
their papers in New York, where it is lawful to
distribute them, but it does not follow that they have a legal
right to that privilege for such a purpose in Louisiana or
Georgia where it is unlawful.”<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> Arguing in this manner,
Kendall arrived at his conclusion that the postmasters should
use their own judgment and act on their own responsibility.</p>

<p>The postmaster general’s letter has been so fully set forth
because it presents, although it by no means solves, all the
constitutional questions to which this situation gave rise.
The disputed issues were destined never to come before the
Supreme Court of the United States for a judicial consideration;
they were, however, to be meagrely discussed on the
floor of the Senate and twenty years later were to be passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
upon by the Attorney General in an official opinion. Was
the Virginia law, including postal officials, constitutional?
Could they be punished for receiving and circulating the
prohibited matter when to do so was required by federal
law as a part of their official duty? Could a citizen of the
state be punished for receiving mail of a certain character?
Were the states competent to exclude from their borders
publications calculated to stir up disaffection among the
slave population?</p>

<p>Attorney General Caleb Cushing was called upon, in
1857, to pass upon some of these questions. The facts of
the particular case presented to him were these: The postmaster
of Yazoo City refused to deliver a newspaper for the
“alleged cause that the same contained matter of which the
tendency and object were to produce disaffection, disorder
and rebellion among the colored population of the state of
Mississippi; and that the delivery of the same by him would
constitute a penitentiary crime according to the laws of
that state.” The removal of the postmaster for malfeasance
in office was requested since the act of July 2, 1836,
provided punishment for postmasters who unlawfully detained
the mail. On the other hand, the laws of Mississippi
made it a crime, punishable by not more than ten years’ imprisonment,
to bring into the state or circulate any printed
matter “calculated to produce disaffection among the slave
population.”<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a></p>

<p>Cushing declared the postal power to be “conferred in
very imperfect terms.” The clause in the Constitution, he
said, provides “for a means or incident without providing
for the principal or end. Still we may take it for granted
here, that, by this phrase, the states designed to communicate
the entire mail power to the United States.” But, on
the other hand, it is indisputable that “each state has, and
must have, jurisdiction as regards the matter of insurrection
or treason. To deny this would be to deny to the inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
of a state the power of self preservation, ... a
right inalienable and imprescriptible.”</p>

<p>With this and the completeness of congressional power
over the mails as premises, Cushing said the question was
as follows: “Has a citizen of one of the United States
plenary, indisputable right to employ the functions and the
officers of the Union as the means of enabling him to produce
insurrection in another of the United States? Can the
officers of the Union lawfully lend its functions to the citizens
of one of the states for the purpose of promoting insurrection
in another state?</p>

<p>“It is obvious to say that, inasmuch as it is the constitutional
obligation of the United States to protect each of the
states against ‘domestic violence’ and to make provisions
to ‘suppress insurrection’” it cannot be the right or duty
of the United States or any of its officers “to promote, or
be the instrument of promoting, insurrection in any part of
the United States.”<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a></p>

<p>Reasoning thus, Cushing concludes “that a deputy postmaster
or other citizen of the United States is not required
by law to become, knowingly, the enforced agent or instrument
of enemies of the public peace, to disseminate, in
their behalf, within the limits of any one of the states of
the Union, printed matter, the design and tendency of which
are to promote insurrection in such state.” But at the outset,
he said, any settlement of the particular case is involved
in “a preliminary question of unsettled fact. The question
is whether the contents of the particular newspaper had for
their tendency and object to incite insurrection in the state
of Mississippi.” There are questions also as to the private
rights of the addressee and the penal obligations of the
deputy postmaster. These are for the courts. They only
can “determine the question of the deputy postmaster’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
penal liability, whether on the side of the United States or
of the state of Mississippi.” The attorney general thus
comes to no absolutely definite conclusion, but the implication
is very strong that there is no federal immunity from
prosecution under the state law, and, conversely, that there
can be no prosecution under federal law for neglect of
duty or malfeasance.</p>

<p>To the same effect, but more clear cut, was the opinion of
John Randolph Tucker sent to Governor Wise of Virginia
on November 26, 1859.<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> The laws of Virginia provided
that “if a postmaster or deputy postmaster know that any
such book or writing [inciting the negroes to rebellion]
has been received at his office in the mail, he shall give notice
thereof to some justice, who shall inquire into the circumstances
and have such book or writing burned in his
presence; if it appears to him that the person to whom it is
directed subscribed therefor, knowing its character, or
agreed to receive it for circulation to aid the purposes of the
abolitionists the justice shall commit such person to jail.
If any postmaster or deputy postmaster violate this section,
he shall be fined not exceeding $200.”</p>

<p>In his opinion, Tucker, as attorney general of the state,
held the law to be entirely constitutional. It does not, he
said, “properly considered, conflict with federal authority
in the establishment of postoffices and postroads. This federal
power to transmit and carry mail matter does not carry
with it the power to publish or circulate....</p>

<p>“With the transmission of the mail matter to the point
of its reception the federal power ceases. At that point
the power of the state becomes exclusive. Whether her
citizens shall receive the mail matter is a question exclusively
for her determination....</p>

<p>“It is true that the postmaster is an officer of the federal
government; but it is equally true that he is a citizen of the
state. By taking a federal office he cannot avoid his duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
as a citizen; and his obligation to perform the duties of his
office cannot absolve him from obedience to the law of the
Commonwealth....</p>

<p>“I have no hesitation in saying that any law of Congress
impairing directly or indirectly this reserved right of the
state is unconstitutional, and that the penalty of the state
law would be imposed upon a postmaster offending against
it, though he should plead his duty to obey such unconstitutional
act of Congress.”</p>

<p>Tucker’s memorandum was sent to Postmaster General
Holt, who cited Cushing’s opinion (which Tucker had not
seen), and ruled against the supremacy of the federal law.
“The people of Virginia,” said Holt, “may not only forbid
the introduction and dissemination of such documents
within their borders, but if brought there in the mails they
may, by appropriate legal proceeding, have them destroyed.
They have the same right to extinguish firebrands thus impiously
hurled into the midst of their houses and altars that
a man has to pluck the burning fuse from a bombshell which
is about to explode at his feet.”</p>

<p>It would seem, however, that such reasoning, while careful
and persuasive, is erroneous. At the time these opinions
were rendered, the absolute supremacy of federal law,
when constitutionally enacted, was not accepted without
question. It is true that, prior to this, provision had been
made for the removal, before trial, of a prosecution arising
under the revenue laws of the United States, and also that
federal judges should have power to grant writs of <i>habeas
corpus</i> in all cases of a prisoner or prisoners in jail or confinement
“where he or they shall be committed or confined
on, or by any authority or law, for any act done, or omitted
to be done in pursuance of a law of the United States, or
any order, process or decree of any judge or court thereof.”<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a></p>

<p>To be sure, this was only a means of checking state action,
but from the doctrine of federal supremacy it logically
follows that it is not within the power of a state to punish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
acts done under authority of federal law. At the time the
question of incendiary publications was acute, the Supreme
Court had not decided the line of cases upholding the right
of removal to federal courts and sanctioning the release of
officers for acts done in pursuance of federal authority.
These cases declared it to be “an incontrovertible principle
that the government of the United States may, by means of
physical force exercised through its agents, execute on every
foot of American soil, the powers and functions that belong
to it. This necessarily involves the power to command
obedience to its laws, and hence the power to keep the peace
to that extent. This power to enforce its laws and to execute
its functions does not derogate from the power of the
states to execute its laws at the same time and in the same
places. The one does not exclude the other, except where
both cannot be executed at the same time. In that case the
words of the Constitution itself show which is to yield.
‘This Constitution, and all laws which shall be made in
pursuance thereof ... shall be the supreme law of the
land.’”<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a></p>

<p>And on the basis of this principle, there is no reason to
hold that the postal employees could not be punished for
distributing the incendiary matter when it was their federal
duty so to do. To be sure, as urged by Cushing and Tucker,
the United States guarantees each state a republican form of
government and protects it against domestic violence, but
this does not mean that a law which is passed by Congress to
apply uniformly to the whole country, and which may, on
account of peculiar local conditions, aid insurrectionary
movements in certain of the states, is thereby unconstitutional.
The resort of the states is not to the courts, but to
Congress for the repeal of the harmful measure. Furthermore,
the guarantee does not obligate the United States to
insure a state against the occurrence of any violence, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
simply to protect it when the violence is attempted. Since,
therefore, the federal laws made criminal the detention of
any mail matter, with only such exceptions as Congress
might introduce, there was no way in which the states might
enforce their laws against incendiary literature, unless they
could exclude it absolutely from their borders.</p>

<p>As to this power, there are no judicial precedents, but the
carriage of the mails being under federal auspices and Congress
having a property right in them, the authority of the
states to exclude, if it exists at all, is certainly narrower
than that in regard to interstate commerce. As to this, the
states may exclude from their borders only such articles as
are intrinsically unfit for commerce and unmerchantable.
The Supreme Court enumerated, as examples, “rags or
other substances infected with the germs of yellow fever,
or the virus of small pox, or cattle, or meat or other provisions
that are diseased or decayed.” These articles “may
be rightly outlawed as intrinsically and directly the immediate
sources and causes of destruction to human health
and life.”<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> Publications calculated to incite the slaves to
rebellion would not fall within this classification. The conclusion,
then, must be that in disseminating the incendiary
literature, the postal agents acted properly, and that the
state laws were inoperative as applied to them. But if the
states have a restricted power of exclusion, such as that defined
in the Bowman case, it is, in effect, a nullity, since circumstances
can hardly be imagined under which its exercise
might take place, without delaying the mails, or violating
federal statutes which attach penalties for opening the mail
and interfering with it while <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in transitu</i>.</p>

<p>There remains the further question whether a state is
competent to forbid its citizens to receive certain mail
matter, and here also the interstate commerce analogy affords
an answer. By a long line of decisions, principally
in regard to intoxicating liquors, it has been established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
that a state may not interfere with a commodity until it has
reached the consignee, who has a right to receive shipments
from without the state.<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> If the state forbids possession,
no matter how acquired, then the question of receiving becomes
academic, since it would be impossible to separate the
two acts. So also, if Congress has excluded a commodity
from interstate commerce, then the consignee’s right to receive
this commodity has been taken away, and the state has
plenary power.<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> The same reasoning applies to the receiving
of mail matter: the state would be competent to
punish only if Congress has forbidden the use of the mails,
as is the case, for example, with lottery tickets and obscene
literature. But in any event, a law directed against receiving
certain mail matter could just as well forbid possession,
and as the state has power in the latter case, the distinction
is without importance except in so far as the possession is
more difficult to detect than the receipt. Certain it is, however,
that, as was attempted by the incendiary literature
legislation, the state may not punish a man for taking from
the mails what the federal government permits to be sent.</p>

<p>This conclusion is applicable to the validity of legislation
forbidding the advertisement of intoxicating liquors. The
state may not keep out, or prevent the receipt of, such advertisements
or journals containing them, when sent through
the mails or interstate commerce; it may forbid the sale of
such journals if not in their “original packages,”<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> and if it
attempts to penalize the possession of such advertisements,
there is no constitutional question so far as the mails are
concerned.</p>

<p>The use of the mails may constitute a crime against the
state, but the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
has gone much farther than previous decisions and in a
recent case declared: “It makes no difference that the
United States Mail was used for the solicitation [of orders
for intoxicating liquors]. The federal government does
not protect those who use its mails to thwart the police
regulations of a state made for the conservation of the welfare
of its citizens. The use of the mail is a mere incident
in carrying out the illegal act, and affords no more protection
in a case like this than a like use of the mails to promote
a criminal conspiracy, or to perpetrate a murder by poison,
or to solicit contributions of office holders in violation of
the civil service law, or to obtain goods under false pretenses.”<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a></p>

<p>In Adams v. The People<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a>&mdash;the case probably meant but
not cited by the last clause of the quotation&mdash;there was an
indictment for obtaining money under false pretenses, although
the defendant was a resident of Ohio and had never
been in New York. So also, in cases referred to by the
Circuit Court of Appeals, the solicitation through the mails
of orders for intoxicating liquors has been punished where
the matter was mailed and received within the limits of the
state and there was no interstate commerce involved.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> But
the Supreme Court decisions cited by the Circuit Court of
Appeals simply hold that Congress may make the use of
the mails a crime when in furtherance of a purpose to
violate federal laws and are obviously not precedents for
sustaining the West Virginia legislation.<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a></p>

<p>Now, the <i>sine qua non</i> of forbidding solicitation by means
of the postoffice is that the sale of the intoxicating liquor
is itself a crime; otherwise the state could have an unrestrained
power to prescribe the purposes for which the mails
might be used. The Circuit Court of Appeals evidently
reasoned on this basis and considered as constitutional the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
section of the state law which provides that “in case of a
sale in which a shipment or delivery of such liquors is made
by a common or other carrier, the sale thereof shall be
deemed to be made in the county wherein the delivery
thereof is made by such carrier to the consignee, his agent,
or employee.” The Court held that such a regulation was
sanctioned by the Webb-Kenyon Act,<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> although admittedly
invalid if not thus justified. This presents a question that
is beyond the purview of the present study, but it is obvious
that if the sales could be made, then the solicitation could
not be made a crime; and it may be added, parenthetically,
that the Court probably erred in holding that the sales were
forbidden.</p>

<p>The case nearest in point&mdash;Rose Co. v. State<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a>&mdash;is not
cited by the Circuit Court’s opinion. The defendant corporation
in Tennessee mailed circulars advertising liquors
to residents of Barton County, Ga. The Georgia law forbade
solicitations where it was unlawful to sell, but the
Supreme Court of Georgia held that shipments could be
made from without the state under the protection of the
commerce clause, and it could not, therefore, be a crime to
use a federal agency in furtherance of a purpose that was
sanctioned by the Federal Constitution.</p>

<p>It may be said, then, that the use of the mails may be
penalized only when in furtherance of a purpose that is unlawful;
nor can it be argued&mdash;as was done with considerable
force by the late James C. Carter against the exclusion
of lottery tickets from the mails<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a>&mdash;that the state may punish
only when the purposes are <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mala in se</i> and not when merely
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mala prohibita</i>. If the state has the power, it may define
“unlawful,” but punishment cannot take place if the act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
sought to be effected by the use of the mails is permitted
by state law, or if the inhibition is invalid, as is, it would
seem, the case with the West Virginia legislation. Finally,
it is difficult to see how the state may forbid anything but
direct solicitation. A magazine or newspaper proprietor
who publishes the advertisements does not use the mails for
the purpose of consummating a crime, and the advertiser
does not use the mails at all. The solicitation, therefore,
must be direct.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a></p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Extension of Federal Control over Postroads</span></span></h2>

<p id="foor"><i>Federal Ownership of Railroads.</i>&mdash;In an address at Indianapolis
on May 30, 1907, President Roosevelt discussing
the necessity for further congressional regulation of railway
companies, declared that, “in so far as the common carriers
also transport the mails, it is, in my opinion, probable
that whether their business is or is not interstate, it is to
the same extent subject to federal control, under that clause
of the Constitution granting to the national government
power to establish postroads, and therefore by necessary
implication power to take all action necessary in order to
keep them at the highest point of efficiency.”<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a></p>

<p>The placing of such a construction upon the postroads
clause aroused a storm of criticism, but, in the main, President
Roosevelt was correct in his assertion of congressional
authority. Municipal streets used by mail carriers or
wagons are postroads and federal control exists to the extent
of insuring safe passage of the mail and prohibiting
private competition; by the rural free delivery system,
moreover, state wagon roads are under federal authority to
the same extent. That much has been made evident by the
preceding discussion.</p>

<p>As to common carriers between the states, congressional
regulation has been very largely based upon the commerce
clause of the Federal Constitution, and the transportation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
of the mails has been a secondary, not primary, ground to
justify the authority exerted. This commercial power does
not extend to intrastate undertakings, but if these were concerned
with furnishing postal facilities they could be brought
under federal control. This doctrine, however, should be
carefully qualified so as not to assert a right in Congress to
assume general supervision, for example, of municipal traction
companies, an incidental function of which is to carry
the mails. The control could be exerted only so far as was
reasonably necessary to insure the safe, speedy, and unobstructed
transportation of government property.</p>

<p>This control, as the Debs<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> case made clear, is, in the case
of interstate carriers at least, and by parity of reasoning in
the case of intrastate undertakings also, not confined to
mere legislative rules, enforceable in the courts, but the
executive power may remove obstructions to the carriage
of the mails. The national government is charged “with
the duty of keeping those highways of interstate commerce
free from obstruction, for it has always been recognized as
one of the powers and duties of a government to remove
obstructions from the highways under its control.” On this
power rests, in large part, at least, the act of October 1,
1888,<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> providing for arbitration between railroad companies
and their employees and subsequent acts for the same purpose.
The full power has not yet been exerted; it extends
to the compulsory settlement of such disputes (subject to
the limitations of the Thirteenth Amendment),<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> and to the
enforcement by federal authority of such regulations as may
be necessary to remove obstructions and insure the carriage
of the mails without delay, even in the case of streets within
a town and with reference to municipal traction companies.</p>

<p>It is no longer open to doubt that the federal government,
under its right of eminent domain, upon the payment of
adequate compensation judicially determined, may compel
service from railroads by which existing terms for the carriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
of the mails may have been deemed unsatisfactory.
This may be done either by assuming the temporary management
of the roads for such a purpose, or by enforcing
criminal provisions against obstructing or delaying the
mails. While such a power has not been exercised, it certainly
exists.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a></p>

<p>But the Senate Committee which in 1874 declared that the
government could thus compel the transportation of the
mails, went still further and maintained that Congress could
“take absolutely, on paying just compensation therefor,
without the consent either of the owner or of the state
within which such road may be, any railroad, its rolling
stock and equipments, within the United States for the public
use and transportation over the same of the United
States mails,”&mdash;an advanced position for this period when
Congress had as yet attempted slight regulation of the railroads.</p>

<p>It should require but little argument, I think, to show that
if Congress decides to nationalize the railways of the country
it may constitutionally do so under its power to establish
postroads. Federal charters to railroads and bridge companies
have been pitched upon the postal, commercial, and
war powers; they have granted rights of way through the
states, immunity from taxation, powers of eminent domain,
and the right of resort to the federal courts on the ground
of federal citizenship. Congress has, moreover, the right
of eminent domain even for patriotic purposes,&mdash;to preserve
the Gettysburg battlefield,&mdash;a much more remote public
purpose than that of establishing postal facilities under
the specific authorization in the Constitution.<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a></p>

<p>In Osborn v. The Bank of the United States,<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> it was
urged upon the Supreme Court that the bank was not an
instrument of the government and a distinction was drawn
between it and an agency for which provision was made in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
the Constitution. “The postoffice is established by the general
government,” said counsel. “It is a public institution.
The persons who perform its duties are public officers.
No individual has or can acquire any property in it.
For all services performed a compensation is paid out of
the national treasury; and all money received upon account
of its operations is public property.” The business “is of
a public character and the charge of it expressly conferred
upon Congress by the Constitution.”<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> This distinction between
the public nature of postal facilities and the private
character of much of the business done by the bank was
urged to show that the latter was subject to taxation by the
state.</p>

<p>To this argument Chief Justice Marshall replied that if
the premises were true, the conclusion would be inevitable.
But there was a political connection between the bank and
the government and “Congress was of the opinion that these
faculties [of doing private business] were necessary to enable
the bank to perform the services which are exacted
from it, and for which it was created.... That the exercise
of these faculties greatly facilitates the fiscal operations
of the government is too obvious for controversy: and who
will venture to affirm that the suppression of them would
not materially affect these operations, and essentially impair,
if not totally destroy, the utility of the machine to the
government?” If the private business engaged in has the
result of making the corporation “a more fit instrument for
the purposes of the government than it otherwise would be,”
then “the capacity to carry on this trade is a faculty indispensable
to the character and objects of the institution.”</p>

<p>There can be no question of the right of the federal government
itself to construct highways for the transportation
of the mail and to charge tolls for their use; nor can there
be any doubt of its power to own and operate carriers, and
incidentally to engage in business of a private nature if
this increases the efficiency of the governmental agency.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Even the fact that these private undertakings, disassociated
from the carriage of the mails, would be by far the most
important, would make no difference, according to the rule
as announced by Chief Justice Marshall. On this theory,
moreover, can be justified the assumption by the federal
government of the functions of a bank and common carrier,
through the postal savings and money order systems, and
the parcel post, even though these activities can also be supported
as proper elements of a postal power as it is interpreted
in other countries.</p>

<p>If, therefore, the federal government is competent to establish
postal facilities and use them for ancillary yet helpful
purposes, there is no reason why it may not exercise its
power of eminent domain and take possession of any or all
agencies now used in the transportation of the mails, upon
the payment of just compensation; own and operate these
agencies, use them to carry the mails, and to perform all
other functions which would “greatly facilitate the fiscal
operations of the government.” In this would, of course,
be included the smaller power of creating a corporation, perhaps
owned in part by the government, to take over and
operate the railroads of the country for the same purposes.
The connection between such a corporation and the government
would be political and public as Marshall pointed out,
but it would be created to carry out a power specifically mentioned
in the Constitution, and its public nature would
therefore be much more apparent. There is thus an error
of understatement when it is urged that “no valid distinction
can be drawn between the vital necessity of the right to
trade in money to a fiscal instrumentality of the government,
and the right to trade in transportation to a transportation
instrumentality of the government.”<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a></p>

<p>It is an arguable proposition that such a purpose could be
accomplished under the commercial power which is simply
that of “regulation.” By many the opinion is held that
this of itself is sufficient to give Congress the right to compel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
industrial corporations doing an interstate business to secure
federal charters. The constitutionality of a law to compel
interstate railroads to incorporate under the commerce clause
is even less doubtful, and the Supreme Court has upheld
the exercise of the commercial power in condemning the
property of a state corporation organized to improve navigation,
just compensation including the value of the franchise
which was destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a> Federal incorporation, then,
may be required on the ground that it is necessary for the
efficient regulation of the carriers. On the other hand, the
postal clause gives Congress the right to establish instrumentalities
for the transportation of the mails, and the assumption
of control or ownership under this grant of power
is more surely within the rule as laid down by Marshall in
Osborn v. The Bank of the United States.</p>

<p>In 1792 the proposal was made in Congress that the proprietors
of mail stages be permitted to carry passengers,
but the motion was lost, on the ground that under the postal
clause Congress did not provide the necessary authority.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a>
It is true, also, that the framers of the Constitution did not,
because they could not, contemplate the taking over by Congress
of the railways of the country. And, as the preceding
discussion has attempted to show, during the early days
of legislative activity under the postroads clause, the consent
of the states was required for construction within
their borders, and they acceded in one form or another to
several of the acts granting federal charters.<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> But, as the
Supreme Court of the United States has said in language
already quoted, the powers of Congress “are not confined
to the instrumentalities of commerce or of the postal service
known or in use when the Constitution was adopted, but
they keep pace with the progress of the country.” This,
coupled with the right of eminent domain, is, it is submitted,
sufficient to enable the national government, either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
directly or through a federally chartered corporation, to
take over and operate the railroads of the country for the
carriage of the mails, with the power of engaging in the
transportation of freight or passengers, to the extent that
Congress may desire.<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a></p>

<p id="ptat"><i>Postal Telegraphs and Telephones.</i>&mdash;The case last cited
is ample authority for Congress to take over and operate
the telegraph and telephone systems of the country, for the
Supreme Court made its pronouncement in upholding the
act of July 24, 1866,<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> “to aid in the construction of telegraph
lines, and to secure to the government the use of the
same for postal, military and other purposes.” The act,
among other things, gave companies complying with its
terms the right to erect their poles and string their wires
along any military or post road, and the Supreme Court declared
void a state statute which attempted to give exclusive
rights to a local company.</p>

<p>By the third section of the congressional act, it was provided
that “the United States may, at any time after the
expiration of five years from the date of the passage of
this act, for postal, military or other purposes, purchase all
the telegraph lines, property and effects of any or all of said
companies at an appraised value, to be ascertained by five
competent, disinterested persons, two of whom shall be selected
by the postmaster general of the United States, two
by the company interested, and one by the four so previously
selected.” The United States therefore reserved to itself
the power which it would otherwise have had,&mdash;that of
eminent domain in respect to telegraph facilities. In his
report for 1913, the postmaster general said:</p>

<p>“A study of the constitutional purposes of the postal establishment
leads to the conviction that the Post Office Department<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
should have control over all means of the communication
of intelligence. The first telegraph line in this
country was maintained and operated as a part of the postal
service, and it is to be regretted that Congress saw fit to
relinquish this facility to private enterprise. The monopolistic
nature of the telegraph business makes it of vital importance
to the people that it be conducted by unselfish interests,
and this can be accomplished only through government
ownership.” If Congress decides to take over these
facilities, its action will be clearly within the postal power.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a></p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Extension of Federal Control through Exclusion
from the Mails</span></span></h2>

<p>It has already been indicated that, while the postal power
of Congress is plenary, extending to the classification and
exclusion of articles presented for transmission through the
mails, it is not without limits; that its exercise is restricted
by provisions found in the Constitution itself,&mdash;the guarantees
of a free press and immunity from unreasonable
searches and seizures. There is, moreover, a further important
limitation in that an arbitrary refusal of postal facilities
would seem to be a denial of due process of law.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of the United States has not yet
been called upon to set any limit to congressional action
under this clause; it has thus far upheld every law restricting
the use of the postoffice. But it should be remembered
in the discussion which follows that all existing exclusions
from the mails can be justified as partaking of the nature of
police regulations; the prohibited articles are either inherently
injurious, inimical to the health, safety and well
being of recipients, or the use of the mails is denied because
it would be in furtherance of a design that is condemned
by moral considerations or is against public policy.</p>

<p>That this <i>Index Expurgatorius</i> will be extended may
be taken for granted. It is in the nature of police regulations
that they expand more inclusively and rigorously. For
example, in 1912 Congress excluded from the mails moving
picture films of prize fights.<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> At the third session of the
Sixty-third Congress, moreover, bills were introduced and
urged to deny absolutely the use of the mails to any person
who, in the opinion of the postmaster general, “is engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
or represents himself as engaged in the business of publishing”
any books or pamphlets of an indecent, immoral, scurrilous
or libelous character. No letter, packet, parcel, newspaper,
book or other thing, said one bill, “sought to be
sent through the postoffice by or on behalf or to or on
behalf of such person shall be deemed mailable matter, and
the postmaster general shall make the necessary rules and
regulations to exclude such non-mailable matter from the
mails.”<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> The proposed legislation was aimed at certain
publications devoted to the unrestrained, defamatory and
often indecent criticism of particular religious denominations
and their clergy.</p>

<p>The constitutionality of this legislation, however, is open
to serious doubt. There can, of course, be no question as
to the impairment of religious freedom, for, while this requires
freedom of attack, it cannot “justify the violation of
public order and common decency”; or, as put by another
authority, “the prohibition does not prevent Congress from
penalizing the commission of acts, which, although justified
by the tenets of a religious sect, are socially or politically
disturbing, or are generally reprobated by the moral sense
of civilized communities.”<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> Nor is the objection that the
freedom of the press would be impaired, since, admitting
that a denial of postal facilities would be an impairment of
the liberty of publication, the federal guarantee does not
include the right to publish scurrilous or libelous utterances
on matters of private concern; or, to take Hamilton’s
test, there is no publication of truth, with good motives and
for justifiable ends.<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a></p>

<p>If the proposed legislation simply made such matter non-mailable
and penalized any attempt to use the postoffice for
its carriage, it would probably be free from objection. But
under the bill quoted above, if it was established that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
person made a practice of sending such matter through
the mails, the postmaster general would have the absolute
authority arbitrarily to deny him facilities for <i>all</i> his mail
matter, much of which would be admittedly innocuous; and
whether, if the objectionable practices were suspended, the
person would again be permitted to make use of the governmental
agency, would depend on the discretion of the postmaster
general. This official’s authority would, in effect,
be to punish for acts not made criminal by Congress. Such
legislation would for this reason seem unconstitutional as
well as ill-considered.</p>

<p>But this exclusion is in a class by itself. It is an attempt
to reach effectively an evil over which there is admittedly
some federal control, for Congress may prevent the transmission
of scurrilous papers. The objection is to the
method of exercise rather than to the existence of the power.
Of a different character is the strongly urged proposal that
congressional control of the mails may be used as a valid
means to compel the performance or non-performance of
certain acts by persons, over whom there exists no direct
federal authority. In other words, it is contended that
Congress has a plenary and arbitrary power to determine
who shall use the mails and what articles shall be carried,
and therefore may impose any antecedent conditions, no
matter how onerous or remote, upon the enjoyment of
postal facilities. With the ever increasing frequency and
importance of problems demanding a solution by the federal
government in the absence of effective, and in some cases
even attempted, settlement by the states, Congress is under
the necessity of casting about for indirect methods of exerting
control, since direct action would be unconstitutional.
The use for this purpose of the taxing and commercial
powers has in some instances been made, and in others
is very strongly urged. It is also argued that Congress
may refuse corporations, to whose size, organization, or
activities, it objects, the right to sue in federal courts and
that national banks may be ordered not to receive their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
deposits. In asking, therefore, whether it is constitutional
for Congress to exert such indirect control under the cloak
of regulating the mails, we will merely consider one phase
of the larger subject of indirect government.</p>

<p>Such an exercise of power over the mails has been advocated
to secure corporate publicity. “Congress,” says one
who is in favor of such extension of federal control, “by
regulating the use of the mails and channels of interstate
commerce, may compel every corporation engaged in any
business, <i>whether interstate or not</i>, to give publicity to its
corporate affairs, by legislation denying the use of the mails
and the instruments of interstate commerce for the transmission
of any matter concerning the affairs or business of
any corporation that fails to make and file reports of the
fullest nature concerning its organization and business, such,
for example, as are already exacted from interstate carriers
under the Interstate Commerce Act. Such legislation would
be valid and enforceable.”<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a></p>

<p>It has been suggested in Congress<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> that an effective punitive
method of dealing with monopolistic corporations would
be to deny them postal facilities.<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> If such corporations were
violating the Sherman Act or were otherwise outlawed by
valid legislation, Congress would have the right to deny
them the use of the mails, since it would be absurd for the
general government to aid, through its instrumentalities,
persons or corporations violating laws which it had passed.
An illustrative case is afforded by the provision of the
Panama Canal Act of August 24, 1912, which says that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
vessel owned by any company doing business in violation
of any of the acts of Congress relating to interstate commerce
“shall be permitted to enter or pass through said
canal.”<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a></p>

<p>But it is a different proposition to urge that Congress may
deny the use of the mails in order to compel corporate
publicity, when, if the legislation directly commanded compliance,
it would be clearly <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ultra vires</i>. Thus, the Pujo
Money Trust Committee proposed “that Congress prohibit
the transmission by the mails or by telegraph or telephone
from one state to another of orders to buy or sell or quotations
or other information concerning transactions on any
stock exchange, unless [among other conditions] such exchange
shall (1) be a body corporate of the state or territory
in which it is located.”<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> This proposal was based upon the
conclusion of a majority of the committee that “Congress
has power to prevent the use of the mails to disseminate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
quotations or other information concerning transactions on
stock exchanges whose facilities are used for purposes of
gambling and price manipulation, and that exercising its
wide choice of means to that end, it may prohibit the transmission
through the mails of any information relating to
transactions on exchanges refusing submission to regulations
reasonably adapted to preventing the objectionable
practices.”<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a></p>

<p>The question arises whether such an exclusion would not
violate the freedom of the press, since newspapers and other
publications could not use the mails if they contained any
information, however harmless and valuable, concerning any
transactions (to which Congress might have no objection)
of the exchange which has refused to accept regulations
which the general government had no power directly to
impose. Newspapers would be unable to circulate truth on
matters of public concern if the published information as
to stock quotations, although harmless in its nature, concerned
an institution whose practices Congress was indirectly
attempting to check. If the law were carefully confined to
the prohibition of the circulation of publications which contained
matter relating to gambling transactions, there would
be no abridgment of the guarantee of the First Amendment.
The exclusion would be similar to that of lottery advertisements,
or matter designed to aid in defrauding recipients.
But as proposed by the Pujo Committee, the law would, at
least in part, if not as a whole, operate as an abridgment of
the freedom of the press.</p>

<p>Apart from this consideration, however, the theory of the
law, differently stated, is that Congress, under its power to
exclude from the mails gambling contracts and matter designed
to defraud recipients, may go farther and exclude
harmless matter because this seems a necessary and adequate
means of compelling the exchanges to take out state
charters, a concession thought by Congress to be desirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
in order to prevent the gambling and other harmful practices,
over which there is no direct national control.</p>

<p>Still other proposals would extend federal authority in a
similar manner. It is urged, for example, that Congress
prohibit the use of the mails by fire insurance companies
which at present are, by means of the postoffice, able to do
business in states where they could not, if they used local
agents.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a> And to give a third example, it was argued that an
efficient means of prohibiting trading in cotton futures would
be to deny the use of the mails for the furtherance of such
transactions.<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> The extent to which the Supreme Court has
thus far recognized in Congress authority of this character,
is only to sanction the refusal to lend federal aid, by furnishing
postal facilities to the furtherance or consummation
of gambling and fraudulent schemes.</p>

<p>One measure of a character somewhat analogous to those
proposals which we have been considering, has, however,
already been sustained by the Supreme Court of the United
States. I refer to the recent so-called “Newspaper Publicity
Law” which requires publications entered as second-class
matter (with a few exceptions) to furnish the postoffice department
with, and publish, a sworn statement giving the
names and addresses of the owners, editors, and business
managers, and, in the case of daily newspapers, circulation
figures. It is provided that “any such publication shall be
denied the privileges of the mail if it shall fail to comply
with the provisions of this paragraph within ten days after
notice by registered letter of such failure.”<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
As claimed in the defendants’ brief, when the law went
before the Supreme Court, Congress had, in effect, attempted
“to regulate journalism.” Relying upon its power
over the postoffice, Congress had threatened those publications
which enjoy second-class rates with a denial of this
privilege should they refuse to comply with the conditions;
and it was, moreover, made a crime to continue to use the
mails and violate the stipulation that all reading matter for
the publication of which a valuable consideration is received,
“shall be plainly marked ‘advertisement.’” Such regulations,
without any reference to the use of the mails, would
be obviously outside the constitutional power of Congress.</p>

<p>By a narrow, but nevertheless a convincing line of reasoning,
the Supreme Court, through Chief Justice White, was
able to justify the law without being put to the necessity of
making any definite declaration as to the limits to which
Congress may go in its exercise of what, lacking a better
phrase, we may call “indirect regulation under the postal
power.”</p>

<p>The Court’s opinion shows that in the classification of
mail matter there has been no attempt at uniformity and
that periodical publications have enjoyed special favors by
reason of legislative adherence to what has been described
as the “historic policy of encouraging by low postal rates
the dissemination of current intelligence.”<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> It is shown
that as a condition precedent to being “entered as second
class mail matter” and enjoying the low rates which are
maintained at a loss, the government demands an answer
to a score of questions concerning ownership, editorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
direction, advertising discrimination, specimen copies, and
circulation. To the Third Assistant Postmaster General is
given the authority of accepting or rejecting applications of
entry at the second-class rate.<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> The Supreme Court
simply considered the law as laying down new conditions,
compliance with which will continue the right “to enjoy
great privileges and advantages at the public expense.” In
its opinion the Court says:</p>

<p>“As the right to consider the character of the publication
as an advertising medium was previously deemed to be
incidental to the exercise of the power to classify for the
purpose of the second class mail, it is impossible in reason to
perceive why the new condition as to marking matter,
which is paid for as an advertisement, is not equally incidental
to the right to classify.</p>

<p>“And the additional exactions as to disclosure of stockholders,
principals, creditors, etc., also are clearly incidental
to the power to classify as are the requirements as to disclosure
of ownership, editors, etc., which for so many years
formed the basis of the right of admission to the classification.
We say this because of the intimate relation which
exists between ownership and debt....</p>

<p>“Considered intrinsically, no completer statement of the
relation which the newly exacted conditions bear to the
great public purpose which induced Congress to continue in
favor of the publishers of newspapers at vast public expense
the low postal rate as well as other privileges accorded
by the second class mail classification, can be made
than was expressed in the report of the Senate Committee
stating the intent of the legislation&mdash;that is, to secure to the
public ‘in the dissemination of knowledge of current
events’ by means of newspapers, the names, not only of
the apparent, but of what might prove to be the real and
substantial owners of the publications and to enable the
public to know whether the matter which was published was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
what it purported to be, or was in substance a paid advertisement.</p>

<p>“We repeat that in considering this subject we are concerned
not with any general regulation of what should be
published in newspapers, nor with any condition excluding
from the right to resort to the mails, but we are concerned
solely and exclusively with the right on behalf of the publishers
to continue to enjoy great privileges and advantages
at the public expense, a right given them by Congress upon
condition of compliance with regulations deemed by that
body incidental and necessary to the complete fruition of
the public policy lying at the foundation of the privileges
accorded.”<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a></p>

<p>This decision thus applies simply to the suspension of
second class privileges and not to any general denial of the
use of the mails. It is significant, moreover, that the Court
expressly refused assent to the contention of the government,
which as paraphrased in the opinion, was that the law
merely “imposes conditions necessary to be complied with
to enable publishers to participate in the great and exclusive
privileges and advantages which arise from the right to use
the second-class mail,” but that even if “the provision be
given the significance attributed to it by the publishers, it is
valid as an exertion by Congress of its power to establish
postoffices and post roads, a power which conveys an absolute
right of legislative selection as to what shall be
carried in the mails, and which, therefore, is not in anywise
subject to judicial control even though in a given case it may
be manifest that a particular exclusion is but arbitrary because
resting on no discernible distinction nor coming within
any discoverable principle of justice or public policy.”</p>

<p>The Court, however, emphatically refused to accept this
view, saying that “because there has developed no necessity
of passing on the question, we do not wish even by the
remotest implication to be regarded as assenting to the
broad contentions concerning the existence of arbitrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
power through the classification of the mails, or by way of
condition, embodied in the proposition of the government
which we have previously stated.”</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has, however, permitted Congress, in
the exercise of its taxing power, and less noticeably in its
control of interstate commerce, to accomplish ends which
were not included in the enumerated delegations of the Constitution.
Thus, the tax on state bank notes which made
their issue unprofitable was upheld on the ground that “the
judiciary cannot prescribe to the legislative department of
the government limitations upon the exercise of its <i>acknowledged</i>
powers. The power to tax may be exercised oppressively
upon persons, but the responsibility of the legislature
is not to the courts, but to the people by whom its
members are elected.”<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> Such a position in this case, however,
was easily justified on the ground that Congress had
the power to stop altogether the issue of the state bank notes
if it thought that this course was necessary in order to
provide an effective currency system, and the case thus loses
much of its apparent importance.<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a></p>

<p>More illustrative, perhaps, of the plenary power of Congress
with respect to the raising of a revenue, and impossible
to justify on such a ground, is the decision upholding
a tax upon oleomargarine so heavy that it can only be
manufactured at a loss. Thus, unable directly to control
manufacture, Congress has achieved the same end through
the exercise of its taxing power. The Supreme Court said:</p>

<p>The argument “when reduced to its last analysis comes to
this: that because a particular department of the government
may exert its lawful powers with the object or motive
of reaching an end not justified, therefore it becomes the
duty of the judiciary to restrain the exercise of a lawful
power whenever it seems to the judicial mind that such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
lawful power has been abused. But this reduces itself to
the contention that under our constitutional system, the
abuse by one department of the government of its lawful
powers is to be corrected by the abuse of its powers by
another department.”<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a></p>

<p>Such reasoning is, it appears, final, although it goes
farther than the Bank Note Case which declared that “there
are indeed certain virtual limitations arising from the principles
of the Constitution itself. It would undoubtedly be
an abuse of the power [that of taxation] if so exercised as
to impair the separate existence and independent self government
of the states or if exercised for ends inconsistent
with the limited grants of power in the Constitution.”<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a>
However, although with more guarded language, the Court,
even in the McCray case, intimated that a judicial veto
might attach to measures which on their face bore evidence
of not being tax laws at all, but were transparent in their
purpose to control subjects not within the power of Congress.
Such a law has not come before the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Not so striking, but nevertheless important illustrations
of this “nullification by indirection”<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> are to be found in
the interstate commerce legislation of recent years. Congress
has excluded lottery tickets from interstate commerce
on account of their harmful effect on recipients;<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
assumed a control over the manufacture of food products
by establishing standards of purity which must be met
before the articles may begin an interstate journey.<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> The
Mann White Slave Act extends federal control to immorality
in the states, and in its decision upholding this law,
the Supreme Court frankly admits that the means exerted
“may have the quality of police regulations.”<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> Proposals
are now made to control manufacturing and trading companies,
whether interstate or not, by compelling them to take
out federal charters and modify their business practices
(over which Congress has no direct control) in accordance
with federal regulations before they will be permitted to
enjoy the facilities of interstate commerce. It is most
strongly urged that the national legislature has the power to
improve labor conditions within the states, the most desired
manifestation being a law putting articles made by children
under specified ages in the same class with lottery tickets
and impure foods.</p>

<p>Up to this time, however, legislation under the commerce
clause has developed little necessity for passing upon the
question whether these ultimate purposes may be considered
by the courts, for the indirect control effected by the various
acts is purely incidental in character. It is quite proper for
Congress to build up an <i>Index Expurgatorius</i> just as it
has done in the case of the mails, and to say that commerce
shall not be “polluted” by the carriage of obscene literature,
impure food, and made an agency to promote immorality.
In every case, the power has been exerted on
<i>things</i>, not on <i>persons</i>, and only once has there been even
an apparent departure from this theory. Here the Supreme
Court by a forced interpretation of the statute destroyed
much of its force. I refer to the “commodities clause” of
the Hepburn Bill which made it unlawful for any railroad
to transport, except for its own use, any commodity other
than timber which it had manufactured, mined, or produced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
or in which it had any interest. The Court interpreted
this as meaning that the railroad was not forbidden
to engage in mining, but that before transporting the
product, it had to divorce itself from any interest by a
<i>bona fide</i> sale. Such legislation, however, was “necessary
and proper” in order to insure the enforcement of the
regulations providing for equality of rates, publications of
tariffs, etc. Any other interpretation would have required
the Court to consider and decide several very “grave constitutional
questions” as to the powers of Congress to regulate
the production and ownership of commodities simply
because they might become subjects of interstate commerce.<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a></p>

<p>But conceding the authority of Congress to regulate child
labor indirectly, upon what theory is it based? In the words
of a reluctant convert, “the lottery case is authority for
the doctrine that interstate carriers may be prohibited from
carrying, or shippers or manufacturers from sending from
state to state and to foreign countries, commodities produced
under conditions so objectionable as to be subject to
control, as to their manufacture, by the states under an
exercise of their police powers, or of a character designed
or appropriate for a use which might similarly be forbidden
by law.”<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a> Such legislation, however, would be directed
against the articles produced under the objectionable conditions,
and the manufacturers who employed child labor
would not be prohibited from using the advantages of interstate
commerce for other articles, not so produced.<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a></p>

<p>There is an obvious distinction between such legislation
and that advocated by the money trust committee, a distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
which is suggested, but not stressed, by the Solicitor
General in the brief filed on behalf of the government in
the newspaper publicity case: there must be no “regulation
of the private business of citizens in a manner beyond any
express or implied power of Congress” on the ground that
such regulation “imposes as a penalty for disobedience a
denial of an important federal privilege which Congress
controls.” Any legislation excluding from the mails must
apply directly to the <i>things</i> mailed, not to the <i>persons</i> using
the mails. This is a distinction which is evident in the decisions
upholding the interstate commerce legislation, and
which underlies the argument that Congress may exclude
commodities manufactured in whole or in part by children.
The law would operate directly on these commodities, not
on account of their inherent character (which would probably
not be different from that of other commodities manufactured
by adult labor), but because of the objectionable
conditions of production. And by a parity of reasoning,
Congress could exclude from the mails matter relating to
gambling transactions which might be forbidden under the
police power of the state, although such matter, on its face,
would be harmless. But it is an entirely different proposition
absolutely to deny the use of the mails because certain
persons have refused to comply with conditions, beyond
the power of Congress directly to impose, which it thinks
may result in regulating objectionable practices, although
these may be entirely disassociated from the bulk of the
matter which has been excluded.</p>

<p>The briefs of counsel on behalf of the Pujo Committee
furnish no argument to change the opinion here expressed
that the proposed legislation would be unconstitutional.<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a>
The validity of the bill is asserted on the ground of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
cases, already considered,<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> upholding the power of Congress
to exclude lottery tickets and fraudulent matter.
Chief importance, however, seems to be attached to a dictum
of a District Court which says:</p>

<p>“If the use of the mails is a privilege which may be
granted or withheld by Congress, Congress has the power
to determine what shall be carried and what excluded ...
under the power to regulate the mails it has seen proper to
declare that they shall not be used for any purposes which
are detrimental to the morals of the people or against public
policy, and by enacting that the sending of obscene matter
through the mails shall not be permissible, it has determined
such acts to be against public policy.”<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> In this case the
only matter before the court was the construction of the
statute; there was no question as to the power of Congress,
and the reasoning making public policy the test is clearly
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">obiter</i>. Counsel for the Pujo Committee, however, boldly
argued as follows:</p>

<p>“It would therefore be within the competency of Congress,
to prohibit absolutely the transmission through the
mails of a circular or pamphlet or newspaper containing the
quotations or information concerning transactions in securities
on stock exchanges or otherwise, just as it has prohibited
the transmission of circulars containing information
with regard to lotteries. Such a prohibition may be absolute
or conditional. Thus Congress might accompany a
prohibition absolute in form with a proviso that its inhibition
should not be applicable to” matter relating to securities
“sold or offered for sale on a stock exchange duly incorporated,
whose charter shall contain provisions similar
to those set forth in the pending bill.” Congress, the argument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
concludes, would simply be laying down a “rule as to
what shall and what shall not be mailable matter, and in
making this classification it is giving expression to what it
conceives to be sound public policy, to the same extent and
in the same way it does when it enacts any other kind of
legislation that comes within the constitutional grant of
legislative powers.”<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a></p>

<p>But, it is submitted, Congress would be doing nothing of
the sort. In the cases of the lottery tickets and obscene
matter, the inhibition was on account of the inherent character
of the matter mailed. If the test was one of public
policy, as the very broad language of the District Court’s
opinion would seem to indicate, Congress simply declared
it not sound public policy that the mails of the United
States should be used in furtherance of transactions that
were harmful. To be sure the Postmaster General is
authorized to seize and detain all letters addressed to a person
against whom a fraud order has issued, but this is
justifiable on the ground that it is reasonably necessary in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
order to make effective the regulations against using the
postoffice to defraud; but Congress has not yet made it a
crime for anyone, some of whose mail matter may come
within the inhibition, to deposit in, or take from, the mails,
letters of a personal and harmless character. It is improper,
then, to argue that in passing the Pujo Bill, Congress
would act “to the same extent and in the same way”
as it has done in the past. The authority of the fraud order
decisions is simply that if Congress excludes matter relating
to gambling transactions (as it probably has the right to
do), correspondence deposited by or addressed to, the person
suspected of unlawfully using the mails, may be seized
and detained in order to make the gambling regulations effective.
But the cases furnish no ground for the belief
that Congress may penalize the use of the mails by these
persons for the transmission of matter that is harmless.
The brief of counsel for the Pujo Committee does not argue
this point; nor does it take the natural, but nevertheless
untenable, further position and maintain that Congress may
make it a crime to deposit this harmless matter in order to
detect violations of a law excluding information concerning
gambling contracts.</p>

<p>On the contrary, counsel conceive the public policy of the
proposed legislation to be the enforcement of the regulations
set forth in the pending bill,&mdash;regulations that are not concerned
with the character of the mail matter, but with
persons using the mails. Not even by twisted interpretations
can the adjudicated cases be made to support such
reasoning. The “newspaper publicity law” which marks
the extreme assertion of congressional authority, applies
directly to the papers mailed. Only one <i>dictum</i>, of a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">nisi
prius</i> court,<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a> lays down the test of public policy, and if,
under its enumerated powers, Congress may legislate in fulfillment
of this vague purpose, there would be a good deal
of difficulty, I fancy, in showing that it would be subserved
by the enforcement of the proposed regulations. And conceding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
that Congress may control the postoffice on grounds
of public policy, the fact that the ends to be attained are
unconnected with the use of the mails, would prevent the
legislative fiat from being final, and the enforcement of the
Pujo Committee’s recommendations would be so onerous
and remote, that it would, I venture, not be permitted.<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a>
Reasoning such as that indulged in by the counsel, moreover,
disregards the principle that runs through all the cases:
the enforcement of postal regulations must be consistent
with the rights reserved to the people. And the Pujo Bill
attempts to regulate, not the mails, but stock exchanges.</p>

<p>The first Employers’ Liability Case,<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> it is submitted, furnishes
sufficient basis to uphold the correctness of the view
that the proposed legislation is unconstitutional. In these
cases it was held that the statute was not confined to a
regulation of interstate commerce, but attempted to control
<i>persons</i>, not only as to their engaging in interstate commerce,
but in other respects, simply because some of their
activities came under the authority of Congress. Furthermore,
the Supreme Court has held that “there is no such
connection between interstate commerce and membership in
a labor organization as to authorize Congress to make it a
crime against the United States for an agent of an interstate
carrier to discharge an employee because of such
membership on his part.”<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a></p>

<p>There are a number of <i>dicta</i> of the United States Supreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
Court, particularly in regard to objectionable state
statutes, which show that attempted indirect regulation is
considered improper, at least for the local legislatures.
First in time and importance comes Marshall’s famous statement,
that “should Congress under pretext of executing
its powers, pass laws for the accomplishment of objects not
entrusted to the government, it would become the painful
duty of this tribunal, should a case requiring such a decision
come before it, to say that such an act was not the law of
the land.”<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a></p>

<p>Or, as was said in another case: “The courts are not
bound by mere forms, nor are they to be misled by mere
pretenses. They are at liberty&mdash;indeed under a solemn
duty&mdash;to look at the substance of things, whenever they
enter upon the inquiry whether the legislature has transcended
the limits of its authority. If, therefore, a statute
purporting to have been enacted to protect the public
health, the public morals, or the public safety, has no real
or substantial relation to those objects, or is a palpable invasion
of the rights secured by fundamental law, it is the
duty of the courts to so adjudge and thereby give effect to
the Constitution.”<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> No power ought to be sought, much
less adjudged, “in favor of the United States, unless it be
clearly within reach of its constitutional charter.” The
courts are “not at liberty to add one jot of power to the
national government beyond what the people have granted
by the Constitution.”<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a></p>

<p>The Court has, moreover, adhered to “the great principle
that what cannot be done directly because of constitutional
restriction, cannot be accomplished indirectly by legislation
which accomplishes the same result.... Constitutional provisions,”
adds Justice Brewer, “whether operating by way
of grant or limitation, are to be enforced according to their
letter and cannot be evaded by any legislation which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
although not in terms trespassing upon the letter and spirit,
yet in substance or effect destroys the grant or limitation.”<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a></p>

<p>It is, moreover, a serious question whether arbitrary exclusions
from the mails would not abridge the guarantee of
due process of law. This question has never been before
the Supreme Court of the United States, but a District
Court has maintained that “the postal monopoly, if granted
and exercised by a citizen or a corporation would, from the
fact of its being a monopoly, make it imperative that all
persons who paid the postal rates and conformed to the
reasonable regulations of the postal service should have a
common right to the use of the mails, and that, because of
the fact of the monopoly thus granted. This right would
be protected in the courts if the citizen or the corporation
controlling the postal service should attempt to deprive him
of it.”</p>

<p>The court then suggests that if the federal government
should become the owner of all transportation lines and
establish a monopoly, facilities would have to be extended
to all, subject “to such general laws and regulations as to
rates and the operation of the lines as might be enacted and
established”; that the right to travel and ship freight
“would be readily recognized as a property right in the
citizen and one of which a particular citizen could not be
deprived except by due process of law. We think the right
to the use of the mails, though in a degree much less valuable,
than the use of the transportation lines, would be
equally a property right, and one which could not be taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
away except by due process of law.”<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a> The use of this
property right would, of course, be subject to police regulations
by Congress, to the extent that they have been upheld
by the Supreme Court, or to which this argument concedes
that they may go,&mdash;always applying, however, directly to
the <i>things</i> mailed.</p>

<p>One of the methods urged for compelling federal incorporation
of trading companies engaged in interstate commerce
is the denial of postal facilities to state chartered
concerns, and concerning this one of the abler advocates
of such an end, says: “If we are correct in believing that
due process requires the equal protection of the laws, an
arbitrary selection or classification is beyond the power of
Congress. A law which divides those who use the mail
into two general classes, all state corporations on the one
hand, and all which are not incorporated by a state on the
other, does not seem based upon any reasonable difference,
either in the character of the person or in the kind of mail
matter sent, which will make the classification more than
arbitrary selection. The constitutionality of this method,
therefore, seems open to grave question.”<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> The conclusion
of this writer, therefore, is that the constitutionality of
the Pujo Bill would be open “to grave question” as denying
due process of law.</p>

<p>Thus far the proposed extension of federal control by
forbidding persons to use the mails, has been objected to as
(in the suggested bill at least) abridging the freedom of the
press, as not being a <i>bona fide</i> regulation of the mails, as
attempting to obviate the objection of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ultra vires</i> by the use
of indirect means, and as denying due process of law.
There is a final consideration, which, while not legally controlling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
is none the less important. Without holding
strictly to a “literary theory”<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a> of the Constitution one can
regret the apparently growing tendency to disregard constitutional
provisions and to sanction all legislation if, by any
twisted interpretation, it can be upheld by the courts, although
it may, as in the case of the postoffice proposals considered
above, be well outside the fairly considered powers
of the law-making body. This tendency shows an impatience
of legal restraint, and a disinclination to follow what may be
called constitutional morality. The phrase is that of
Grote,<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> who, describing Athenian Democracy in the time
of Kleisthenes, emphasized the necessity for “a perfect confidence
in the bosom of every citizen, amidst the bitterness
of party contest, that the forms of the constitution will be
no less sacred in the eyes of his opponents than in his own.”
Such constitutional morality he called “a natural sentiment”
as it exists in the United States, but these words will
no longer be true if Congress may extend its control in the
manner proposed, without waiting for a grant of authority
in the manner provided for by the Constitution.<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a></p>

<p>And if the courts should permit such extensions of federal
control, enormous powers will, by judicial construction,
be taken from the states and given over to the national
legislature. For, as it is hardly necessary to remark, the
denial of postal and interstate commerce facilities would
be almost as efficacious as positive legislation; without using
the mails and the channels of trade no business could successfully
exist. If congressional control may be thus extended,
every business and every individual needing to use
the mails would become subject to federal regulation on
the vague ground of public policy. The reserved powers of
the states would then exist only by the sufferance of Congress,
and the cardinal theory of the American system&mdash;that
the federal government is one of enumerated powers&mdash;would
become a cynical fiction.</p>

that the “ministerial post will die a natural death; it has
been under a languishment a great while; it would be cowardice to
issue a decree to kill that which is dying; it brought but one letter
last time and was obliged to retail newspapers to pay its expenses.”
Lee was more facetious, saying: “Is there not a Doctor, Lord North,
who can keep this creature alive?” On December 25, 1775, it was
announced that incoming mail would not be sent to the various
colonies but would be held in New York and advertised.</p></div>

Massachusetts, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina,
and South Carolina opposed; Pennsylvania, Virginia, Georgia
in favor). This incident in the Federal Convention was to figure in
the congressional debates over the incorporation of banks and the
construction of postroads. Opinions have differed as to whether the
action of the Convention may be said to show that the Constitution
did not contemplate the exercise by Congress of a power to incorporate.
Madison’s record says: “Mr. King thought the power unnecessary....
Mr. Wilson mentioned the importance of facilitating
by canals the communication with the Western Settlements. As to
Banks, he did not think with Mr. King that the power in that point
of view would excite the prejudices and parties apprehended. As to
mercantile monopolies, they are already included in the power to
regulate trade.” Farrand, vol. iii, p. 615. Madison’s later opinion
(1824) was that a general power to incorporate had been negatived.

and that it would be improper in me, after your negative, to allow

expectation that I would do it. I have therefore decided ... to
recommend the procuring of an amendment from the states, so as to
vest the right in Congress.” Writings of James Monroe, vol. vi,
p. 32. Madison replied, approving this course. “<i>The expediency of
vesting in Congress</i>,” he said, “a power as to roads and canals, I
have never doubted, and there has never been a moment when such
a proposition to the states was so likely to be approved.” Letters ...

wrote to Monroe concerning the Cumberland Road: “I cannot assign
the grounds assumed for it by Congress, or which produced his
[Jefferson’s] sanction. I suspect that the question of constitutionality
was but slightly, if at all, examined by the former, and that the
executive consent was doubtingly and hesitatingly given. Having
once become a law and being a measure of singular utility, additional
appropriations took place of course under the same administration,
and with the accumulated impulse thus derived, were continued
under the succeeding one, with less critical investigation,
perhaps, than was due to the case.” Madison, Works, vol. iii, p. 55.</p></div>

the prohibition of private letter carrying within the limits of such a

that the liberty of the press may be affected by duties on publications
which might be “so high as to amount to a prohibition....
We know that newspapers are taxed in Great Britain, and yet it is
notorious that the press nowhere enjoys greater liberty than in that
country.” The extent of duties, if levied, “must depend on legislative
discretion, regulated by public opinion.... It would be quite
as significant to declare that the government ought to be free, that
taxes ought not to be excessive, etc., as that the liberty of the press
ought not to be restrained.” Newspapers were in fact taxed during
the Civil War, and revenue to the amount of $980,089 was raised by
this means. Lalor, Encyclopaedia of Political Science, (Art.,
“Press”), vol. iii, 321.

Commenting upon Hamilton’s position, Story remarked: “The
want of a bill of rights then, is not either an unfounded or illusory
objection. The real question is not, whether every sort of right or
privilege or claim ought to be affirmed in a constitution; but whether
such, as in their own nature are of vital importance, ought not to
receive this solemn sanction.” Story, Commentaries, vol. iii, p. 721.</p></div>

Harlan’s dissent, Professor Schofield’s criticism of the majority

and Respublica v. Oswald, 1 Dall. 319 (1788). In U.&nbsp;S. v. Cruikshank,
92 U.&nbsp;S. 542 (1876), the court held: “The First Amendment to the
Constitution ... like the other amendments proposed and adopted
at the same time, was not intended to limit the powers of the state
governments in respect to their own citizens, but to operate upon
the national government alone. ‘The scope and application of these
amendments are no longer subjects of discussion here,’ They left
the authority of the states just where they found it, and added
nothing to the already existing powers of the United States.”
</p>
<p>
Professor Schofield is of the opinion that the Slaughter House
Cases, 16 Wall. 36 (1872), are authority for the principle that “the
right to publish truth on matters of national public concern is one
of the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States
protected from abridgment by any state by the first prohibition in
the Fourteenth Amendment.” Freedom of the Press in the United
States, p. 113. It was held in U.&nbsp;S. v. Hall, 26 Fed. Cas. 79 (1871),
that “the right of freedom of speech, and other rights enumerated
in the first eight articles of amendment to the Constitution of the
United States, are the privileges and immunities of citizens of the
United States, that they are secured by the Constitution, that Congress
has the power to protect them by appropriate legislation.”
See Lien, Privileges and Immunities of Citizens of the United States,
p. 69. The Supreme Court in Patterson v. Colorado, above, refused
to decide whether the liberty of the press declared in the First
Amendment, is included by the word “liberty” in the Fourteenth
Amendment. These questions, however, are outside the purview of
the present discussion.</p></div>

Henry Wolfe Bilké in his paper on “The Jurisdiction of the United
States over Seditious Libel,” 50 American Law Register, 1. Mr.
Bilké says: “The power to punish, for seditious libel, it is submitted,
results to the United States, first from its inherent right to
adopt such measures as are necessary for its self-preservation, and
second, from its right to adopt such measures as are necessary to
secure its officers in the due administration of their duties.” While
it is the better view that Congress has no powers inherent in sovereignty
(see 1 Willoughby on the Constitution, 66), the Supreme
Court apparently rested its decisions in the Chinese Exclusion
Cases [<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sub. nom.</i> Chae Chan Ping v. U.&nbsp;S., 130 U.&nbsp;S. 581 (1888),
and especially Fong Yue Ting v. U.&nbsp;S., 149 U.&nbsp;S. 698 (1892)] on
a contrary theory. These cases furnish the authority for the first
conclusion just quoted, while the case of In Re Neagle, 135 U.&nbsp;S.
1 (1889), is made the basis for the second reason why it is within
the power of the United States to punish sedition. At the time of
the passage of the act, it had not yet been decided that the federal
courts possessed no common law criminal jurisdiction. U.&nbsp;S. v.
Hudson &amp; Goodwin, 7 Cranch 32 (1812). The Federalists maintained
that such jurisdiction did exist, and that since sedition was a
common law offence, Congress could make it statutory and thus aid
the courts in its punishment.</p></div>

may punish seditious utterances counseling the use of force

exemptions are made for the transportation of the mail. Cf.
State v. Norfolk &amp; W.&nbsp;R. Co., 33 W. Va. 440 (1890). A typical
Sunday observance statute is the following: “No person whatsoever
shall work or do any bodily labor on the Lord’s day, commonly
called Sunday; and no person having children or servants shall command,
or wittingly or willingly suffer any of them to do any manner
of work or labor on the Lord’s day (works of necessity and charity
always excepted)” (Public General Laws of Maryland (ed. of 1904),
art. xxvii, sec. 384). The general proposition that the state regulations
do not apply to postal employees is supported by Commonwealth
v. Knox, 6 Mass. 76 (1809), which held that it is not an indictable
offence for a carrier of the mail to travel on Sunday. This exemption
was not applied to passengers, “nor may he [the carrier] blow
his horn to the disturbance of serious people.” An indictment did
lie, however, against the chief justice of Massachusetts and his
associates for travelling on Sunday (1793). See “Sunday Laws,”
in 2 American Law Review, 226.</p></div>

was a “pleasure carriage” within the meaning of the local statute
imposing tolls for the use of the road. The use of state facilities
by persons employed in the federal civil service, said the court,
“must be deemed intended to be on the terms prescribed to all
persons, unless the law under which it is performed declared the
contrary. We have found no act of Congress exempting persons
or carriages engaged in the business of the postoffice from the payment
of tolls for passing ferries, bridges or roads.” Payment was,

“To interfere with the penal laws of a state,” he said, “where they
are not levelled against the legitimate powers of the Union, but have
for their sole object the internal government of the country, is a
very serious measure which Congress cannot be disposed to adopt
lightly or inconsiderately. The motives for it must be serious and

would be clearly and unequivocally expressed.”</p></div>

drawn between <i>acknowledged</i> powers and <i>implied</i> powers of Congress.
For example, the power to tax and to regulate interstate
commerce is granted in the Constitution, while that to exclude from
the mails is implied from the postal clause. From this it is argued
that Congress may be limited in its indirect control under an <i>implied</i>
power when the same objection would not apply to the exercise of
an <i>acknowledged</i> power. (See the brief of James M. Beck in the
newspaper publicity case, printed in Cong. Rec., December 11, 1912.)
But this distinction has never been sanctioned by the Supreme Court

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_448" id="Footnote_448" href="#FNanchor_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> Regulation of the Stock Exchange, p. 657. The proposal in the
Pujo Bill to deny unincorporated stock exchanges the use of the
telephone or telegraph for the transmission of their quotations,
raises the question whether Congress may exercise such indirect
control under the guise of regulating interstate commerce. This
question is discussed in the briefs (Regulation of the Stock Exchange,
p. 570 ff. and p. 660 ff.), and is outside the purview of the
present essay. From the brief review which I have attempted of
the interstate commerce cases, however, it does not appear that they
lend any support to the proposition contended for by the Pujo
Committee. Generally speaking, the same principles are applicable,
in relation to the power over interstate commerce as in relation to
that over the mails as furnishing a means by which indirect control
may be exerted. But it is proper to point out two possible differences:
(1) an exclusion from interstate commerce is <i>prima facie</i> a
“regulation” within the meaning of the grant in the Constitution;
an exclusion from the mails, on the contrary, is not made “to establish
postoffices,” and it would seem, therefore, that the inhibition
would have to be justified as “necessary and proper” to this end;
(2) postal facilities are established and maintained by Congress for
use, upon the same terms, by everyone standing in the same relation
to the government, and it is therefore possible to argue that a denial
of these facilities would be improper, when an equally arbitrary
regulation of interstate commerce might not be. Neither of these
differences, it may be added, is so clear as to be controlling; the
first seems to me of probable importance, but the second, while it
has been suggested, is of doubtful validity.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_450" id="Footnote_450" href="#FNanchor_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> The point here made, to repeat, is that if Congress can legislate
on grounds of public policy, its regulations must be connected
with the use of the mails. The proposed legislation does not seem to
fulfill this condition, for much, if not the greater part of the matter
transmitted, would be harmless. It should be added, however (although
the policy of the legislation is not here considered), that, conceding
the power of Congress to act for the accomplishment of purposes
not connected with the proper use of the mails, there are not
unimportant economic objections to the proposed law. (Regulation of
the Stock Exchange, p. 527 ff. and p. 585 ff.) These objections, I
think, would have to be examined by the courts if Congress should
be allowed the power which I have attempted to show it does not
possess.</p></div>
